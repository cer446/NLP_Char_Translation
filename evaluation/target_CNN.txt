One day, Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez was walking along the streets of downtown Los Angeles when he heard beautiful music.
And the source was a man, an African-American man, charming, rugged, homeless, playing a violin that only had two strings.
Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard, he suffered a complete breakdown, and 30 years later he was living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles.
I met Mr.
He had just heard a performance of Beethoven's First and Fourth symphonies, and came backstage and introduced himself.
He was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton and how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series, all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement of Beethoven's Fourth Symphony.
And we got talking about music, and I got an email from Steve a few days later saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me.
Now, I should mention that Nathaniel refuses treatment because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and Thorazine and handcuffs, and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life.
But as a result now, he is prone to these schizophrenic episodes, the worst of which can manifest themselves as and then disappearing for days, wandering the streets of Skid Row, exposed to its horrors, with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him.
And Nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall -- he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes, he was lost.
And he was talking about invisible demons and smoke, and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep.
So, I just started playing.
And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto.
And as I played, I understood that there was a profound change occurring in Nathaniel's eyes.
It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical, a chemical reaction, for which my playing the music was its catalyst.
And Nathaniel's manic rage was transformed into understanding, a quiet curiosity and grace.
And in a miracle, he lifted his own violin and he started playing, by ear, certain snippets of violin concertos which he then asked me to complete -- Mendelssohn, Tchaikovsky, Sibelius.
And we started talking about music, from Bach to Beethoven and Brahms, Bruckner, all the B's, from Bartok, all the way up to Esa-Pekka Salonen.
And I understood that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music, but he related to this music at a personal level.
He spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that I share with my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
And through playing music and talking about music, this man had transformed from the paranoid, disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of downtown Los Angeles to the charming, erudite, brilliant, Juilliard-trained musician.
Music is medicine.
And for Nathaniel, music is sanity.
Because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity, into reality.
And that is an escape from his tormented state.
And I understood that this was the very essence of art.
This was the very reason why we made music, that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core, our emotions, and through our artistic lens, through our creativity, we're able to shape those emotions into reality.
And the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us, inspires and unites us.
And for Nathaniel, music brought him back into a fold of friends.
The redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him, that recognized his talents and respected him.
And I will always make music with Nathaniel, whether we're at Walt Disney Concert Hall or on Skid Row, because he reminds me why I became a musician.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Thank you.
Robert Gupta.
Robert Gupta: I'm going to play something that I shamelessly stole from cellists.
So, please forgive me.
So, I've known a lot of fish in my life.
I've loved only two.
That first one, it was more like a passionate affair.
It was a beautiful fish: flavorful, textured, meaty, a bestseller on the menu.
What a fish.
Even better, it was farm-raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability.
So you could feel good about selling it.
I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months.
One day, the head of the company called and asked if I'd speak at an event about the farm's sustainability.
"Absolutely," I said.
Here was a company trying to solve what's become this unimaginable problem for us chefs: How do we keep fish on our menus? .
For the past 50 years, we've been fishing the seas like we clear-cut forests.
It's hard to overstate the destruction.
Ninety percent of large fish, the ones we love -- the tunas, the halibuts, the salmons, swordfish -- they've collapsed.
There's almost nothing left.
So, for better or for worse, aquaculture, fish farming, is going to be a part of our future.
A lot of arguments against it: Fish farms pollute -- most of them do anyway -- and they're inefficient.
It's got a feed conversion ratio of 15 to one.
That means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna.
Not very sustainable.
It doesn't taste very good either.
So here, finally, was a company trying to do it right.
I wanted to support them.
The day before the event, I called the head of P.
Let's call him Don.
"Don," I said, "just to get the facts straight, you guys are famous for farming so far out to sea, you don't pollute.
"That's right," he said.
And then he added, "We're basically a world unto ourselves.
That feed conversion ratio? 2.
"Best in the business.
2.
"2.
"Sustainable proteins," he said.
"Great," I said.
And that night, I was lying in bed, and I thought: What the hell is a sustainable protein? .
So the next day, just before the event, I called Don.
I said, "Don, what are some examples of sustainable proteins?" .
He said he didn't know.
Well, I got on the phone with a few people in the company; no one could give me a straight answer until finally, I got on the phone with the head biologist.
Let's call him Don too.
"Don," I said, "what are some examples of sustainable proteins?" .
Well, he mentioned some algaes and some fish meals, and then he said chicken pellets.
I said, "Chicken pellets?" .
He said, "Yeah, feathers, skin, bone meal, scraps, dried and processed into feed.
I said, "What percentage of your feed is chicken?" .
Thinking, you know, two percent.
"Well, it's about 30 percent," he said.
I said, "Don, what's sustainable about feeding chicken to fish?" .
There was a long pause on the line, and he said, "There's just too much chicken in the world.
I fell out of love with this fish.
No, not because I'm some self-righteous, goody-two shoes foodie.
I actually am.
No, I actually fell out of love with this fish because, I swear to God, after that conversation, the fish tasted like chicken.
This second fish, it's a different kind of love story.
It's the romantic kind, the kind where the more you get to know your fish, you love the fish.
I first ate it at a restaurant in southern Spain.
A journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time.
She kind of set us up.
It came to the table a bright, almost shimmering, white color.
The chef had overcooked it.
Like twice over.
Amazingly, it was still delicious.
Who can make a fish taste good after it's been overcooked? .
I can't, but this guy can.
Let's call him Miguel -- actually his name is Miguel.
And no, he didn't cook the fish, and he's not a chef, at least in the way that you and I understand it.
He's a biologist at Veta La Palma.
It's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain.
It's at the tip of the Guadalquivir river.
Until the 1980s, the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians.
They raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands.
They did it by draining the land.
They built this intricate series of canals, and they pushed water off the land and out into the river.
Well, they couldn't make it work, not economically.
And ecologically, it was a disaster.
It killed like 90 percent of the birds, which, for this place, is a lot of birds.
And so in 1982, a Spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land.
What did they do? .
They reversed the flow of water.
They literally flipped the switch.
Instead of pushing water out, they used the channels to pull water back in.
They flooded the canals.
They created a 27,000-acre fish farm -- bass, mullet, shrimp, eel -- and in the process, Miguel and this company completely reversed the ecological destruction.
The farm's incredible.
I mean, you've never seen anything like this.
You stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away, and all you see are flooded canals and this thick, rich marshland.
I was there not long ago with Miguel.
He's an amazing guy, like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee.
Okay? There we are slogging through the wetlands, and I'm panting and sweating, got mud up to my knees, and Miguel's calmly conducting a biology lecture.
Here, he's pointing out a rare Black-shouldered Kite.
Now, he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton.
And here, here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe.
It turns out, Miguel spent the better part of his career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa.
I asked him how he became such an expert on fish.
He said, "Fish? I didn't know anything about fish.
I'm an expert in relationships.
And then he's off, launching into more talk about rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants.
And don't get me wrong, that was really fascinating, you know, the biotic community unplugged, kind of thing.
It's great, but I was in love.
And my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before.
So I interrupted him.
He pointed at the algae.
"I know, dude, the algae, the phytoplankton, the relationships: It's amazing.
But what are your fish eating? .
What's the feed conversion ratio?" .
Well, he goes on to tell me it's such a rich system that the fish are eating what they'd be eating in the wild.
The plant biomass, the phytoplankton, the zooplankton, it's what feeds the fish.
The system is so healthy, it's totally self-renewing.
There is no feed.
Ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals? .
Later that day, I was driving around this property with Miguel, and I asked him, I said, "For a place that seems so natural, unlike like any farm I'd ever been at, how do you measure success?" .
At that moment, it was as if a film director called for a set change.
And we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight: thousands and thousands of pink flamingos, a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see.
"That's success," he said.
"Look at their bellies, pink.
They're feasting.
Feasting? I was totally confused.
I said, "Miguel, aren't they feasting on your fish?" .
"Yes," he said.
"We lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds.
Well, last year, this property had 600,000 birds on it, more than 250 different species.
It's become, today, the largest and one of the most important private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe.
I said, "Miguel, isn't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm?" .
He shook his head, no.
He said, "We farm extensively, not intensively.
This is an ecological network.
The flamingos eat the shrimp.
The shrimp eat the phytoplankton.
So the pinker the belly, the better the system.
Okay, so let's review: a farm that doesn't feed its animals, and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators.
A fish farm, but also a bird sanctuary.
Oh, and by the way, those flamingos, they shouldn't even be there in the first place.
They brood in a town 150 miles away, where the soil conditions are better for building nests.
Every morning, they fly 150 miles into the farm.
And every evening, they fly 150 miles back.
They do that because they're able to follow the broken white line of highway A92.
No kidding.
I was imagining a "March of the Penguins" thing, so I looked at Miguel.
I said, "Miguel, do they fly 150 miles to the farm, and then do they fly 150 miles back at night? .
Do they do that for the children?" .
He looked at me like I had just quoted a Whitney Houston song.
He said, "No; they do it because the food's better.
I didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish, which was delicious -- and I don't like fish skin; I don't like it seared, I don't like it crispy.
It's that acrid, tar-like flavor.
I almost never cook with it.
Yet, when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain, it tasted not at all like fish skin.
It tasted sweet and clean, like you were taking a bite of the ocean.
I mentioned that to Miguel, and he nodded.
He said, "The skin acts like a sponge.
It's the last defense before anything enters the body.
It evolved to soak up impurities.
And then he added, "But our water has no impurities.
OK.
And then I realized when he says, "A farm that has no impurities," he made a big understatement, because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the Guadalquivir River.
It's a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days: chemical contaminants, pesticide runoff.
And when it works its way through the system and leaves, the water is cleaner than when it entered.
The system is so healthy, it purifies the water.
So, not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals, not just a farm that measures its success by the health of its predators, but a farm that's literally a water purification plant -- and not just for those fish, but for you and me as well.
Because when that water leaves, it dumps out into the Atlantic.
A drop in the ocean, I know, but I'll take it, and so should you, because this love story, however romantic, is also instructive.
You might say it's a recipe for the future of good food, whether we're talking about bass or beef cattle.
What we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture, one in which the food actually tastes good.
But for a lot people, that's a bit too radical.
We're not realists, us foodies; we're lovers.
We love farmers' markets, we love small family farms, we talk about local food, we eat organic.
And when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food, someone, somewhere stands up and says, "Hey guy, I love pink flamingos, but how are you going to feed the world?" .
How are you going to feed the world? .
Can I be honest? .
I don't love that question.
No, not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world.
One billion people will go hungry today.
One billion -- that's more than ever before -- because of gross inequalities in distribution, not tonnage.
Now, I don't love this question because it's determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years.
Feed grain to herbivores, pesticides to monocultures, chemicals to soil, chicken to fish, and all along agribusiness has simply asked, "If we're feeding more people more cheaply, how terrible could that be?" .
That's been the motivation, it's been the justification: it's been the business plan of American agriculture.
We should call it what it is: a business in liquidation, a business that's quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible.
That's not a business, and it isn't agriculture.
Our breadbasket is threatened today, not because of diminishing supply, but because of diminishing resources.
Not by the latest combine and tractor invention, but by fertile land; not by pumps, but by fresh water; not by chainsaws, but by forests; and not by fishing boats and nets, but by fish in the sea.
Want to feed the world? .
Let's start by asking: How are we going to feed ourselves? .
Or better: How can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself? .
To do that, don't look at the agribusiness model for the future.
It's really old, and it's tired.
It's high on capital, chemistry and machines, and it's never produced anything really good to eat.
Instead, let's look to the ecological model.
That's the one that relies on two billion years of on-the-job experience.
Look to Miguel, farmers like Miguel.
Farms that aren't worlds unto themselves; farms that restore instead of deplete; farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively; farmers that are not just producers, but experts in relationships.
Because they're the ones that are experts in flavor, too.
And if I'm going to be really honest, they're a better chef than I'll ever be.
You know, I'm okay with that, because if that's the future of good food, it's going to be delicious.
Thank you.
So what we're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age.
This tool that I'm using here is a little experiment.
It's called Pivot, and with Pivot what I can do is I can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths -- say, accidents.
And, right away, I see there's a different pattern that emerges.
This is because, in the mid-area here, people are at their most active, and over here they're at their most frail.
We can step back out again and then reorganize the data by cause of death, seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects, but not for everyone.
If we go ahead and we filter by age -- say 40 years or less -- we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about.
And if you drill into that, it's especially the case for men.
So you get the idea that viewing information, viewing data in this way, is a lot like swimming in a living information info-graphic.
And if we can do this for raw data, why not do it for content as well? .
So what we have right here is the cover of every single Sports Illustrated ever produced.
It's all here; it's all on the web.
You can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk.
With Pivot, you can drill into a decade.
You can drill into a particular year.
You can jump right into a specific issue.
So I'm looking at this; I see the athletes that have appeared in this issue, the sports.
I'm a Lance Armstrong fan, so I'll go ahead and I'll click on that, which reveals, for me, all the issues in which Lance Armstrong's been a part of.
Now, if I want to just kind of take a peek at these, I might think, "Well, what about taking a look at all of cycling?" .
So I can step back, and expand on that.
And I see Greg LeMond now.
And so you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way -- going narrower, broader, backing in, backing out -- you're not searching, you're not browsing.
You're doing something that's actually a little bit different.
It's in between, and we think it changes the way information can be used.
So I want to extrapolate on this idea a bit with something that's a little bit crazy.
What we're done here is we've taken every single Wikipedia page and we reduced it down to a little summary.
So the summary consists of just a little synopsis and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from.
I'm only showing the top 500 most popular Wikipedia pages right here.
But even in this limited view, we can do a lot of things.
Right away, we get a sense of what are the topical domains that are most popular on Wikipedia.
I'm going to go ahead and select government.
Now, having selected government, I can now see that the Wikipedia categories that most frequently correspond to that are Time magazine People of the Year.
So this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one Wikipedia page.
It's only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them.
Looking at one of these particular summaries, I can then drill into the concept of Time magazine Person of the Year, bringing up all of them.
So looking at these people, I can see that the majority come from government; some have come from natural sciences; some, fewer still, have come from business -- there's my boss -- and one has come from music.
And interestingly enough, Bono is also a TED Prize winner.
So we can go, jump, and take a look at all the TED Prize winners.
So you see, we're navigating the web for the first time as if it's actually a web, not from page-to-page, but at a higher level of abstraction.
And so I want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise.
I'm just showing the New York Times website here.
So Pivot, this application -- I don't want to call it a browser; it's really not a browser, but you can view web pages with it -- and we bring that zoomable technology to every single web page like this.
So I can step back, pop right back into a specific section.
Now the reason why this is important is because, by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way, I can look at my entire browsing history in the exact same way.
So I can drill into what I've done over specific time frames.
Here, in fact, is the state of all the demo that I just gave.
And I can sort of replay some stuff that I was looking at earlier today.
And, if I want to step back and look at everything, I can slice and dice my history, perhaps by my search history -- here, I was doing some nepotistic searching, looking for Bing, over here for Live Labs Pivot.
And from these, I can drill into the web page and just launch them again.
It's one metaphor repurposed multiple times, and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data.
So right now, in this world, we think about data as being this curse.
We talk about the curse of information overload.
We talk about drowning in data.
What if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down, so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next, we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things, and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden? .
If we can do that, then instead of being trapped in data, we might actually extract information.
And, instead of dealing just with information, we can tease out knowledge.
And if we get the knowledge, then maybe even there's wisdom to be found.
So with that, I thank you.
I grew up on a steady diet of science fiction.
In high school, I took a bus to school an hour each way every day.
And I was always absorbed in a book, science fiction book, which took my mind to other worlds, and satisfied, in a narrative form, this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had.
And you know, that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever I wasn't in school I was out in the woods, hiking and taking "samples" -- frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water -- and bringing it back, looking at it under the microscope.
You know, I was a real science geek.
But it was all about trying to understand the world, understand the limits of possibility.
And my love of science fiction actually seemed mirrored in the world around me, because what was happening, this was in the late '60s, we were going to the moon, we were exploring the deep oceans.
Jacques Cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places and a wondrous world that we could never really have previously imagined.
So, that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it.
And I was an artist.
I could draw.
And I found that because there weren't video games and this saturation of CG movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape, I had to create these images in my head.
You know, we all did, as kids having to read a book, and through the author's description, put something on the movie screen in our heads.
And so, my response to this was to paint, to draw alien creatures, alien worlds, robots, spaceships, all that stuff.
I was endlessly getting busted in math class doodling behind the textbook.
That was -- the creativity had to find its outlet somehow.
And an interesting thing happened: The Jacques Cousteau shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on Earth.
I might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday -- that seemed pretty darn unlikely.
But that was a world I could really go to, right here on Earth, that was as rich and exotic as anything that I had imagined from reading these books.
So, I decided I was going to become a scuba diver at the age of 15.
And the only problem with that was that I lived in a little village in Canada, 600 miles from the nearest ocean.
But I didn't let that daunt me.
I pestered my father until he finally found a scuba class in Buffalo, New York, right across the border from where we live.
And I actually got certified in a pool at a YMCA in the dead of winter in Buffalo, New York.
And I didn't see the ocean, a real ocean, for another two years, until we moved to California.
Since then, in the intervening 40 years, I've spent about 3,000 hours underwater, and 500 hours of that was in submersibles.
And I've learned that that deep-ocean environment, and even the shallow oceans, are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination.
Nature's imagination is so boundless compared to our own meager human imagination.
I still, to this day, stand in absolute awe of what I see when I make these dives.
And my love affair with the ocean is ongoing, and just as strong as it ever was.
But when I chose a career as an adult, it was filmmaking.
And that seemed to be the best way to reconcile this urge I had to tell stories with my urges to create images.
And I was, as a kid, constantly drawing comic books, and so on.
So, filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories together, and that made sense.
And of course the stories that I chose to tell were science fiction stories: "Terminator," "Aliens" and "The Abyss.
And with "The Abyss," I was putting together my love of underwater and diving with filmmaking.
So, you know, merging the two passions.
Something interesting came out of "The Abyss," which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film, which was to create this kind of liquid water creature, we actually embraced computer generated animation, CG.
And this resulted in the first soft-surface character, CG animation that was ever in a movie.
And even though the film didn't make any money -- barely broke even, I should say -- I witnessed something amazing, which is that the audience, the global audience, was mesmerized by this apparent magic.
You know, it's Arthur Clarke's law that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
They were seeing something magical.
And so that got me very excited.
And I thought, "Wow, this is something that needs to be embraced into the cinematic art.
So, with "Terminator 2," which was my next film, we took that much farther.
Working with ILM, we created the liquid metal dude in that film.
And it did, and we created magic again, and we had the same result with an audience -- although we did make a little more money on that one.
So, drawing a line through those two dots of experience came to, "This is going to be a whole new world," this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists.
So, I started a company with Stan Winston, my good friend Stan Winston, who is the premier make-up and creature designer at that time, and it was called Digital Domain.
And the concept of the company was that we would leapfrog past the analog processes of optical printers and so on, and we would go right to digital production.
And we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while.
But we found ourselves lagging in the mid '90s in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do.
And the envelope pushed back, and I was told by the folks at my company that we weren't going to be able to do this for a while.
So, I shelved it, and I made this other movie about a big ship that sinks.
You know, I went and pitched it to the studio as "'Romeo and Juliet' on a ship: "It's going to be this epic romance, passionate film.
Secretly, what I wanted to do was I wanted to dive to the real wreck of "Titanic.
And that's why I made the movie.
And that's the truth.
But I convinced them.
We'll be using it in the opening of the film.
It will be really important.
And I talked them into funding an expedition.
Sounds crazy.
Because we actually created a reality where six months later, I find myself in a Russian submersible two and a half miles down in the north Atlantic, looking at the real Titanic through a view port.
Not a movie, not HD -- for real.
Now, that blew my mind.
And it took a lot of preparation, we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things.
But, it struck me how much this dive, these deep dives, was like a space mission.
You know, where it was highly technical, and it required enormous planning.
You get in this capsule, you go down to this dark hostile environment where there is no hope of rescue if you can't get back by yourself.
And I thought like, "Wow.
This is really cool.
And so, I really got bitten by the bug of deep-ocean exploration.
Of course, the curiosity, the science component of it -- it was everything.
And it was an experience that Hollywood couldn't give me.
Because, you know, I could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it.
So, I was completely smitten by this, and had to do more.
And so, I actually made a kind of curious decision.
After the success of "Titanic," I said, "OK, I'm going to park my day job as a Hollywood movie maker, and I'm going to go be a full-time explorer for a while.
And so, we started planning these And we wound up going to the Bismark, and exploring it with robotic vehicles.
We went back to the Titanic wreck.
We took little bots that we had created that spooled a fiber optic.
And the idea was to go in and do an interior survey of that ship, which had never been done.
Nobody had ever looked inside the wreck.
So, you know, here I am now, on the deck of Titanic, sitting in a submersible, and looking out at planks that look much like this, where I knew that the band had played.
And I'm flying a little robotic vehicle through the corridor of the ship.
When I say, "I'm operating it," but my mind is in the vehicle.
I felt like I was physically present inside the shipwreck of Titanic.
And it was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience I've ever had, because I would know before I turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it, because I had walked the set for months when we were making the movie.
And the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprints of the ship.
So, it was this absolutely remarkable experience.
And it really made me realize that the telepresence experience -- that you actually can have these robotic avatars, then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle, into this other form of existence.
It was really, really quite profound.
And it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post-human futures that I can imagine, as a science fiction fan.
So, having done these expeditions, and really beginning to appreciate what was down there, such as at the deep ocean vents where we had these amazing, amazing animals -- they're basically aliens right here on Earth.
They live in an environment of chemosynthesis.
They don't survive on sunlight-based system the way we do.
And so, you're seeing animals that are living next to a 500-degree-Centigrade You think they can't possibly exist.
At the same time I was getting very interested in space science as well -- again, it's the science fiction influence, as a kid.
And this was fascinating.
But what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep.
And taking them down so that they had access -- astrobiologists, planetary scientists, people who were interested in these extreme environments -- taking them down to the vents, and letting them see, and take samples and test instruments, and so on.
So, here we were making documentary films, but actually doing science, and actually doing space science.
I'd completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan, you know, as a kid, and doing this stuff for real.
And you know, along the way in this journey of discovery, I learned a lot.
I learned a lot about science.
I didn't really learn about leadership until I did these expeditions.
Because I had to, at a certain point, say, "What am I doing out here? .
Why am I doing this? What do I get out of it?" .
We don't make money at these damn shows.
We barely break even.
People sort of think I went away between "Titanic" and "Avatar" and was buffing my nails someplace, sitting at the beach.
Made all these films, made all these documentary films for a very limited audience.
No fame, no glory, no money.
You're doing it for the task itself, for the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is -- for the thrill of discovery, and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a tightly knit team.
Because we would do these things with 10, 12 people, working for years at a time, sometimes at sea for two, three months at a time.
And in that bond, you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you, that you've done a task that you can't explain to someone else.
Creates a bond, creates a bond of respect.
So, when I came back to make my next movie, which was "Avatar," I tried to apply that same principle of leadership, which is that you respect your team, and you earn their respect in return.
And it really changed the dynamic.
So, here I was again with a small team, in uncharted territory, doing "Avatar," coming up with new technology that didn't exist before.
Tremendously exciting.
Tremendously challenging.
And we became a family, over a four-and-half year period.
And it completely changed how I do movies.
So, people have commented on how, "Well, you know, you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of Pandora.
To me, it was more of a fundamental way of doing business, the process itself, that changed as a result of that.
So, what can we synthesize out of all this? .
You know, what are the lessons learned? .
Well, I think number one is curiosity.
It's the most powerful thing you own.
Imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality.
And the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels in the world.
I have young filmmakers come up to me and say, "Give me some advice for doing this.
And I say, "Don't put limitations on yourself.
Other people will do that for you -- don't do it to yourself, don't bet against yourself, and take risks.
NASA has this phrase that they like: "Failure is not an option.
But failure has to be an option in art and in exploration, because it's a leap of faith.
And no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk.
You have to be willing to take those risks.
So, that's the thought I would leave you with, is that in whatever you're doing, failure is an option, but fear is not.
I'm going to talk today about energy and climate.
And that might seem a bit surprising because my full-time work at the Foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds, about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives.
But energy and climate are extremely important to these people -- in fact, more important than to anyone else on the planet.
The climate getting worse means that many years, their crops won't grow: There will be too much rain, not enough rain, things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support.
And that leads to starvation, it leads to uncertainty, it leads to unrest.
So, the climate changes will be terrible for them.
Also, the price of energy is very important to them.
In fact, if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of, to reduce poverty, by far you would pick energy.
Now, the price of energy has come down over time.
Really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy.
The coal revolution fueled the Industrial Revolution, and, even in the 1900s we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity, and that's why we have refrigerators, air-conditioning, we can make modern materials and do so many things.
And so, we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world.
But, as we make it cheaper -- and let's go for making it twice as cheap -- we need to meet a new constraint, and that constraint has to do with CO2.
CO2 is warming the planet, and the equation on CO2 is actually a very straightforward one.
Now, the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of CO2 to what temperature will be and where the positive feedbacks are, there's some uncertainty there, but not very much.
And there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be, but they will be extremely bad.
I asked the top scientists on this several times: Do we really have to get down to near zero? .
Can't we just cut it in half or a quarter? .
And the answer is that until we get near to zero, the temperature will continue to rise.
And so that's a big challenge.
It's very different than saying "We're a twelve-foot-high truck trying to get under a ten-foot bridge, and we can just sort of squeeze under.
This is something that has to get to zero.
Now, we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year, over 26 billion tons.
For each American, it's about 20 tons; for people in poor countries, it's less than one ton.
It's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet.
And, somehow, we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero.
It's been constantly going up.
It's only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all, so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling, and falling all the way to zero.
So, let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero.
Probably, one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.
Now that's back from high school algebra, but let's take a look.
First, we've got population.
The world today has 6.
That's headed up to about nine billion.
Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent, but there we see an increase of about 1.
The second factor is the services we use.
This encompasses everything: the food we eat, clothing, TV, heating.
These are very good things: getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet.
And it's a great thing for this number to go up.
In the rich world, perhaps the top one billion, we probably could cut back and use less, but every year, this number, on average, is going to go up, and so, over all, that will more than double the services delivered per person.
Here we have a very basic service: Do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework? .
And, in fact, these kids don't, so they're going out and reading their school work under the street lamps.
Now, efficiency, E, the energy for each service, here finally we have some good news.
We have something that's not going up.
Through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting, through different types of cars, different ways of building buildings -- there are a lot of services where you can bring Some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent.
There are other services like how we make fertilizer, or how we do air transport, where the rooms for improvement are far, far less.
And so, overall here, if we're optimistic, we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even, perhaps, a factor of six.
But for these first three factors now, we've gone from 26 billion to, at best, maybe 13 billion tons, and that just won't cut it.
So let's look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of CO2 put out per each unit of energy.
And so the question is: Can you actually get that to zero? .
If you burn coal, no.
If you burn natural gas, no.
Almost every way we make electricity today, except for the emerging renewables and nuclear, puts out CO2.
And so, what we're going to have to do at a global scale, is create a new system.
And so, we need energy miracles.
Now, when I use the term "miracle," I don't mean something that's impossible.
The microprocessor is a miracle.
The Internet and its services are a miracle.
So, the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles.
Usually, we don't have a deadline, where you have to get the miracle by a certain date.
Usually, you just kind of stand by, and some come along, some don't.
This is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline.
Now, I thought, "How could I really capture this? .
Is there some kind of natural illustration, some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here?" .
I thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquitos, and somehow people enjoyed that.
It really got them involved in the idea of, you know, there are people who live with mosquitos.
So, with energy, all I could come up with is this.
I decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year.
So here we have some natural fireflies.
I'm told they don't bite; in fact, they might not even leave that jar.
Now, there's all sorts of gimmicky solutions like that one, but they don't really add up to much.
We need solutions -- either one or several -- that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability, and, although there's many directions people are seeking, I really only see five that can achieve the big numbers.
I've left out tide, geothermal, fusion, biofuels.
Those may make some contribution, and if they can do better than I expect, so much the better, but my key point here is that we're going to have to work on each of these five, and we can't give up any of them because they look daunting, because they all have significant challenges.
Let's look first at the burning fossil fuels, either burning coal or burning natural gas.
What you need to do there, seems like it might be simple, but it's not, and that's to take all the CO2, after you've burned it, going out the flue, pressurize it, create a liquid, put it somewhere, and hope it stays there.
Now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level, but getting up to that full percentage, that will be very tricky, and agreeing on where these CO2 quantities should be put will be hard, but the toughest one here is this long-term issue.
Who's going to be sure? .
Who's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things? .
This is a lot of volume.
So that's a tough one.
Next would be nuclear.
It also has three big problems: Cost, particularly in highly regulated countries, is high; the issue of the safety, really feeling good about nothing could go wrong, that, even though you have these human operators, that the fuel doesn't get used for weapons.
And then what do you do with the waste? .
And, although it's not very large, there are a lot of concerns about that.
So three very tough problems that might be solvable, and so, should be worked on.
The last three of the five, I've grouped together.
These are what people often refer to as the renewable sources.
And they actually -- although it's great they don't require fuel -- they have some disadvantages.
One is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant.
This is energy farming, so you're talking about many square miles, thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant.
Also, these are intermittent sources.
The sun doesn't shine all day, it doesn't shine every day, and, likewise, the wind doesn't blow all the time.
And so, if you depend on these sources, you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time periods that it's not available.
So, we've got big cost challenges here, we have transmission challenges: for example, say this energy source is outside your country; you not only need the technology, but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere.
And, finally, this storage problem.
And so, in fact, we need a big breakthrough here, something that's going to be a factor of 100 better than the approaches we have now.
It's not impossible, but it's not a very easy thing.
Now, this shows up when you try to get the intermittent source to be above, say, 20 to 30 percent of what you're using.
If you're counting on it for 100 percent, you need an incredible miracle battery.
Now, how we're going to go forward on this -- what's the right approach? .
Is it a Manhattan Project? What's the thing that can get us there? .
Well, we need lots of companies working on this, hundreds.
In each of these five paths, we need at least a hundred people.
And a lot of them, you'll look at and say, "They're crazy.
And, I think, here in the TED group, we have many people who are already pursuing this.
Bill Gross has several companies, including one called eSolar that has some great solar thermal technologies.
Vinod Khosla's investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities, and I'm trying to help back that.
Nathan Myhrvold and I actually are backing a company that, perhaps surprisingly, is actually taking the nuclear approach.
There are some innovations in nuclear: modular, liquid.
And innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago, so the idea that there's some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising.
The idea of TerraPower is that, instead of burning a part of uranium -- the one percent, which is the U235 -- we decided, "Let's burn the 99 percent, the U238.
It is kind of a crazy idea.
In fact, people had talked about it for a long time, but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not, and so it's through the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that, yes, with the right material's approach, this looks like it would work.
And, because you're burning that 99 percent, you have greatly improved cost profile.
You actually burn up the waste, and you can actually use as fuel all the leftover waste from today's reactors.
So, instead of worrying about them, you just take that.
It breathes this uranium as it goes along, so it's kind of like a candle.
You can see it's a log there, often referred to as a traveling wave reactor.
In terms of fuel, this really solves the problem.
I've got a picture here of a place in Kentucky.
This is the leftover, the 99 percent, where they've taken out the part they burn now, so it's called depleted uranium.
That would power the U.
And, simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process, you'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet.
So, you know, it's got lots of challenges ahead, but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward.
So let's think: How should we measure ourselves? .
What should our report card look like? .
Well, let's go out to where we really need to get, and then look at the intermediate.
For 2050, you've heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduction.
That really is very important, that we get there.
And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries, still some agriculture, hopefully we will have cleaned up forestry, cement.
So, to get to that 80 percent, the developed countries, including countries like China, will have had to switch their electricity generation altogether.
So, the other grade is: Are we deploying this zero-emission technology, have we deployed it in all the developed countries and we're in the process of getting it elsewhere? .
That's super important.
That's a key element of making that report card.
So, backing up from there, what should the 2020 report card look like? .
Well, again, it should have the two elements.
We should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions: The less we emit, the less that sum will be of CO2, and, therefore, the less the temperature.
But in some ways, the grade we get there, doing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions, is only equally, or maybe even slightly less, important than the other, which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs.
These breakthroughs, we need to move those at full speed, and we can measure that in terms of companies, pilot projects, regulatory things that have been changed.
There's a lot of great books that have been written about this.
The Al Gore book, "Our Choice" and the David McKay book, "Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air.
They really go through it and create a framework that this can be discussed broadly, because we need broad backing for this.
There's a lot that has to come together.
So this is a wish.
It's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology.
If you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years -- I could pick who's president, I could pick a vaccine, which is something I love, or I could pick that this thing that's half the cost with no CO2 gets invented -- this is the wish I would pick.
This is the one with the greatest impact.
If we don't get this wish, the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible, between the U.
So, what do we have to do? .
What am I appealing to you to step forward and drive? .
We need to go for more research funding.
When countries get together in places like Copenhagen, they shouldn't just discuss the CO2.
They should discuss this innovation agenda, and you'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches.
We do need the market incentives -- CO2 tax, cap and trade -- something that gets that price signal out there.
We need to get the message out.
We need to have this dialogue be a more rational, more understandable dialogue, including the steps that the government takes.
This is an important wish, but it is one I think we can achieve.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The tough thing is building the pilot reactor; finding the several billion, finding the regulator, the location that will actually build the first one of these.
Once you get the first one built, if it works as advertised, then it's just clear as day, because the economics, the energy density, are so different than nuclear as we know it.
And so, to understand it right, this involves building deep into the ground almost like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel, of this sort of spent uranium, and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down? .
BG: That's right.
So, if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a log -- put it down and not have those same complexities.
And it just sits there and burns for the 60 years, and then it's done.
It's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution.
BG: Yeah.
And we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today, that's sitting in these cooling pools or dry casking by reactors -- that's our fuel to begin with.
So, the thing that's been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed into ours, and you're reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as you're going through this process.
I mean, you're talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here.
Where is there most interest in actually doing something with this? .
So I'm optimistic.
This is a variant on something that has been done.
It's an important advance, but it's like a fast reactor, and a lot of countries have built them, so anybody who's done a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first one gets built.
So, in your mind, timescale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live? .
BG: Well, we need -- for one of these high-scale, electro-generation things that's very cheap, we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deploy.
That's sort of the deadline that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet.
And, you know, TerraPower, if things go well -- which is wishing for a lot -- could easily meet that.
And there are, fortunately now, dozens of companies -- we need it to be hundreds -- who, likewise, if their science goes well, if the funding for their pilot plants goes well, that they can compete for this.
And it's best if multiple succeed, because then you could use a mix of these things.
We certainly need one to succeed.
In terms of big-scale possible game changes, is this the biggest that you're aware of out there? .
BG: An energy breakthrough is the most important thing.
It would have been, even without the environmental constraint, but the environmental constraint just makes it so much greater.
In the nuclear space, there are other innovators.
You know, we don't know their work as well as we know this one, but the modular people, that's a different approach.
There's a liquid-type reactor, which seems a little hard, but maybe they say that about us.
If this doesn't work, then what? .
Do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable? .
BG: If you get into that situation, it's like if you've been over-eating, and you're about to have a heart attack: Then where do you go? You may need heart surgery or something.
There is a line of research on what's called geoengineering, which are various techniques that would delay the heating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together.
Now, that's just an insurance policy.
You hope you don't need to do that.
Some people say you shouldn't even work on the insurance policy because it might make you lazy, that you'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you.
I'm not sure that's wise, given the importance of the problem, but there's now the geoengineering discussion about -- should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster, or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect? .
Climate skeptics: If you had a sentence or two to say to them, how might you persuade them that they're wrong? .
BG: Well, unfortunately, the skeptics come in different camps.
The ones who make scientific arguments are very few.
Are they saying that there's negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things? .
There are very, very few things that they can even say there's a chance in a million of those things.
The main problem we have here, it's kind of like AIDS.
You make the mistake now, and you pay for it a lot later.
The fact is it's that uncertain part that should move us towards this.
BG: Well, the actual spending on the R&D piece -- say the U.
It shouldn't take away from other things.
The thing you get into big money on, and this, reasonable people can disagree, is when you have something that's non-economic and you're trying to fund that -- that, to me, mostly is a waste.
Unless you're very close and you're just funding the learning curve and it's going to get very cheap, I believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive.
If the trade-off you get into is, "Let's make energy super expensive," then the rich can afford that.
I mean, all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle.
The disaster is for that two billion.
And even Lomborg has changed.
His shtick now is, "Why isn't the R&D getting more discussed?" .
He's still, because of his earlier stuff, still associated with the skeptic camp, but he's realized that's a pretty lonely camp, and so, he's making the R&D point.
And so there is a thread of something that I think is appropriate.
The R&D piece, it's crazy how little it's funded.
Well Bill, I suspect I speak on the behalf of most people here to say I really hope your wish comes true.
BG: Thank you.
Several years ago here at TED, Peter Skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge.
And the idea's pretty simple: Teams of four have to build the tallest free-standing structure out of 20 sticks of spaghetti, one yard of tape, one yard of string and a marshmallow.
The marshmallow has to be on top.
And, though it seems really simple, it's actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly.
And so, I thought this was an interesting idea, and I incorporated it into a design workshop.
And it was a huge success.
So, normally, most people begin by orienting themselves to the task.
They talk about it, they figure out what it's going to look like, they jockey for power.
Then they spend some time planning, organizing, they sketch and they lay out spaghetti.
They spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever-growing structures.
And then finally, just as they're running out of time, someone takes out the marshmallow, and then they gingerly put it on top, and then they stand back, and -- ta-da! -- they admire their work.
But what really happens, most of the time, is that the "ta-da" turns into an "uh-oh," because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse.
So there are a number of people who have a lot more "uh-oh" moments than others, and among the worst are recent graduates of business school.
They lie, they cheat, they get distracted and they produce really lame structures.
And of course there are teams that have a lot more "ta-da" structures, and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten.
And it's pretty amazing.
As Peter tells us, not only do they produce the tallest structures, but they're the most interesting structures of them all.
So the question you want to ask is: How come? Why? What is it about them? .
And Peter likes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be CEO of Spaghetti, Inc.
They don't spend time jockeying for power.
But there's another reason as well.
And the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan, right? .
And then they execute on it.
And then what happens is, when they put the marshmallow on the top, they run out of time and what happens? .
It's a crisis.
Sound familiar? Right.
What kindergarteners do differently is that they start with the marshmallow, and they build prototypes, successive prototypes, always keeping the marshmallow on top, so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way.
Designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iterative process.
And with each version, kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn't work.
So the capacity to play in prototype is really essential, but let's look at how different teams perform.
So the average for most people is around 20 inches; business schools students, about half of that; lawyers, a little better, but not much better than that, kindergarteners, better than most adults.
Who does the very best? .
Architects and engineers, thankfully.
Thirty-nine inches is the tallest structure I've seen.
And why is it? Because they understand triangles and self-reinforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building stable structures.
So CEOs, a little bit better than average, but here's where it gets interesting.
If you put you put an executive admin.
It's incredible.
You can just tell beforehand.
Because they have special skills of facilitation.
They manage the process, they understand the process.
And any team who manages and pays close attention to work will significantly improve the team's performance.
Specialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination that leads to strong success.
If you have 10 teams that typically perform, you'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures.
And I tried something interesting.
I thought, let's up the ante, once.
So I offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team.
So what do you think happened to these design students? .
What was the result? .
Here's what happened: Not one team had a standing structure.
If anyone had built, say, a one inch structure, they would have taken home the prize.
So, isn't that interesting? That high stakes have a strong impact.
We did the exercise again with the same students.
What do you think happened then? .
So now they understand the value of prototyping.
So the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best.
They produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time.
So there's deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success.
So, you might ask: Why would anyone actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge? .
And the reason is, I help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects.
And what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions.
Because, frankly, every project has its own marshmallow, doesn't it? .
The challenge provides a shared experience, a common language, a common stance to build the right prototype.
And so, this is the value of the experience, of this so simple exercise.
And those of you who are interested may want to go to MarshmallowChallenge.
It's a blog that you can look at how to build the marshmallows.
There's step-by-step instructions on this.
There are crazy examples from around the world of how people tweak and adjust the system.
There's world records that are on this as well.
And the fundamental lesson, I believe, is that design truly is a contact sport.
It demands that we bring all of our senses to the task, and that we apply the very best of our thinking, our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand.
And sometimes, a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an "uh-oh" moment to a "ta-da" moment.
And that can make a big difference.
Thank you very much.
Let's pretend right here we have a machine.
A big machine, a cool, TED-ish machine, and it's a time machine.
And everyone in this room has to get into it.
And you can go backwards, you can go forwards; you cannot stay where you are.
And I wonder what you'd choose, because I've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm convinced that there's some sort of pull to nostalgia, to wishful thinking.
And I understand that.
I'm not part of that crowd, I have to say.
I don't want to go back, and it's not because I'm adventurous.
It's because possibilities on this planet, they don't go back, they go forward.
So I want to get in the machine, and I want to go forward.
This is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose: health, wealth, mobility, opportunity, declining rates of disease .
There's never been a time like this.
My great-grandparents died, all of them, by the time they were 60.
My grandparents pushed that number to 70.
My parents are closing in on 80.
So there better be a nine at the beginning of my death number.
But it's not even about people like us, because this is a bigger deal than that.
A kid born in New Delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did 100 years ago.
Think about that, it's an incredible fact.
And why is it true? .
Smallpox.
It reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever has.
It's gone.
We vanquished it.
In the rich world, diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist, hardly.
Diphtheria, rubella, polio .
does anyone even know what those things are? .
Vaccines, modern medicine, our ability to feed billions of people, those are triumphs of the scientific method.
And to my mind, the scientific method -- trying stuff out, seeing if it works, changing it when it doesn't -- is one of the great accomplishments of humanity.
So that's the good news.
Unfortunately, that's all the good news because there are some other problems, and they've been mentioned many times.
And one of them is that despite all our accomplishments, a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day.
That number's rising, and it's rising really rapidly, and it's disgraceful.
And not only that, we've used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe.
Potable water, arable land, rainforests, oil, gas: they're going away, and they're going away soon, and unless we innovate our way out of this mess, we're going away too.
So the question is: Can we do that? And I think we can.
I think it's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on.
I think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it.
I really do believe that, and, no, it ain't wishful thinking.
But here's the thing that keeps me up at night -- one of the things that keeps me up at night: We've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now.
And we've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today.
People wrap themselves in their beliefs, and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free.
Not even the truth will set them free.
And, listen, everyone's entitled to their opinion; they're even entitled to their opinion about progress.
But you know what you're not entitled to? .
You're not entitled to your own facts.
And this took me awhile to figure out.
About a decade ago, I wrote a story about vaccines for The New Yorker.
And I was amazed to find opposition: opposition to what is, after all, the most effective public health measure in human history.
I didn't know what to do, so I just did what I do: I wrote a story and I moved on.
And soon after that, I wrote a story about genetically engineered food.
Same thing, only bigger.
People were going crazy.
So I wrote a story about that too, and I couldn't understand why people thought this was "Frankenfoods," why they thought moving molecules around in a specific, rather than a haphazard way, was trespassing on nature's ground.
But, you know, I do what I do.
I mean, I'm a journalist.
We type, we file, we go to dinner.
But these stories bothered me, and I couldn't figure out why, and eventually I did.
And that's because those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren't actually fanatics at all.
They were thoughtful people, educated people, decent people.
They were exactly like the people in this room.
And it just disturbed me so much.
But then I thought, you know, let's be honest.
We're at a point in this world where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to.
We talk about it ambivalently.
We talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it: "progress.
Okay, there are reasons for that, and I think we know what those reasons are.
We've lost faith in institutions, in authority, and sometimes in science itself, and there's no reason we shouldn't have.
You can just say a few names and people will understand.
Chernobyl, Bhopal, the Challenger, Vioxx, weapons of mass destruction, hanging chads.
You know, you can choose your list.
There are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right, so be skeptical.
Ask questions, demand proof, demand evidence.
Don't take anything for granted.
But here's the thing: When you get proof, you need to accept the proof, and we're not that good at doing that.
And the reason that I can say that is because we're now in an epidemic of fear like one I've never seen and hope never to see again.
About 12 years ago, there was a story published, a horrible story, that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine shot.
Very scary.
Tons of studies were done to see if this was true.
Tons of studies should have been done; it's a serious issue.
The data came back.
The data came back from the United States, from England, from Sweden, from Canada, and it was all the same: no correlation, no connection, none at all.
It doesn't matter.
We don't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data, and I do understand that, I think we all do.
But you know what? .
The result of that has been disastrous.
Disastrous because here's a fact: The United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is going down.
That is disgraceful, and we should be ashamed of ourselves.
It's horrible.
What kind of a thing happened that we could do that? .
Now, I understand it.
Because, did anyone have measles here? .
Has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of measles? .
Doesn't happen very much.
Doesn't happen in this country at all, but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year.
That's a lot of death of measles -- 20 an hour.
But since it didn't happen here, we can put it out of our minds, and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like "Oprah" and "Larry King Live.
And they can do it because they don't link causation and correlation.
They don't understand that these things seem the same, but they're almost never the same.
And it's something we need to learn, and we need to learn it really soon.
This guy was a hero, Jonas Salk.
He took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us.
No fear, no agony.
That guy in the middle, not so much.
His name is Paul Offit.
He just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people.
It'll save the lives of 400 to 500,000 kids in the developing world every year.
Pretty good, right? .
Well, it's good, except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the whining.
And he actually says it that way.
So, Paul's a terrorist.
When Paul speaks in a public hearing, he can't testify without armed guards.
He gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school.
And why? Because Paul made a vaccine.
I don't need to say this, but vaccines are essential.
You take them away, disease comes back, horrible diseases.
We have measles in this country now.
And it's getting worse, and pretty soon kids are going to die of it again because it's just a numbers game.
And they're not just going to die of measles.
What about polio? Let's have that.
A college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought I was a little strident.
No one's ever said that before.
She wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio, no way.
Fine.
Why? Because we don't have polio.
We didn't have polio in this country yesterday.
Today, I don't know, maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning, and he's flying to LAX, right now he's over Ohio.
And he's going to land in a couple of hours, he's going to rent a car, and he's going to come to Long Beach, and he's going to attend one of these fabulous TED dinners tonight.
And he doesn't know that he's infected with a paralytic disease, and we don't either because that's the way the world works.
That's the planet we live on.
Now, we love to wrap ourselves in lies.
Everyone take their vitamins this morning? .
Echinacea, a little antioxidant to get you going.
I know you did because half of Americans do every day.
They take the stuff, and they take alternative medicines, and it doesn't matter how often we find out that they're useless.
The data says it all the time.
They darken your urine.
It's okay, you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine? .
I'm totally with you.
Dark urine.
Why do we do that? Why do we do that? .
Well, I think I understand, we hate Big Pharma.
We hate Big Government.
And we shouldn't: Our health care system sucks.
It's cruel to millions of people.
It's absolutely astonishingly cold and soul-bending to those of us who can even afford it.
So we run away from it, and where do we run? .
We leap into the arms of Big Placebo.
That's fantastic.
But, you know, it's really a serious thing because this stuff is crap, and we spend billions of dollars on it.
And I have all sorts of little props here.
None of it .
And you know what? When I say this stuff, people scream at me, and they say, "What do you care? Let people do what they want to do.
It makes them feel good.
And you know what? You're wrong.
Because I don't care if it's the secretary of HHS who's saying, "Hmm, I'm not going to take the evidence of my experts on mammograms," or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enemas.
When you start down the road where belief and magic replace evidence and science, you end up in a place you don't want to be.
You end up in Thabo Mbeki South Africa.
He killed 400,000 of his people by insisting that beetroot, garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs we know can slow the course of AIDS.
Hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease.
Please, don't tell me there are no consequences to these things.
There are.
Now, the most mindless epidemic we're in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between proponents of genetically engineered food and the organic elite.
It's an idiotic debate.
It's a debate about words, about metaphors.
It's ideology, it's not science.
Every single thing we eat, every grain of rice, every sprig of parsley, every Brussels sprout has been modified by man.
You know, there weren't tangerines in the garden of Eden.
There wasn't any cantaloupe.
There weren't Christmas trees.
We made it over the last 11,000 years.
And some of it worked, and some of it didn't.
We got rid of the stuff that didn't.
Now we can do it in a more precise way -- and there are risks, absolutely -- but we can put something like vitamin A into rice, and that stuff can help millions of people, millions of people, prolong their lives.
You don't want to do that? .
I have to say, I don't understand it.
We object to genetically engineered food.
Why do we do that? .
Well, the things I constantly hear are: Too many chemicals, pesticides, hormones, monoculture, we don't want giant fields of the same thing, that's wrong.
We don't companies patenting life.
We don't want companies owning seeds.
And you know what my response to all of that is? .
Yes, you're right.
It's true, we've got a huge food problem, but this isn't science.
This has nothing to do with science.
It's law, it's morality, it's patent stuff.
You know science isn't a company.
It's not a country.
It's not even an idea; it's a process.
It's a process, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we're afraid, is really very deadening, and it's preventing millions of people from prospering.
You know, in the next 50 years we're going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now, 70 percent.
This investment in Africa over the last 30 years.
Disgraceful.
They need it, and we're not giving it to them.
And why? Genetically engineered food.
We don't want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff, like cassava for instance.
Cassava's something that half a billion people eat.
It's kind of like a potato.
It's just a bunch of calories.
It doesn't have nutrients, it doesn't have protein, and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now.
And then people would be able to eat it and they'd be able to not go blind.
They wouldn't starve, and you know what? .
That would be nice.
And all I can say about this is: Why are we fighting it? .
I mean, let's ask ourselves: Why are we fighting it? .
Because we don't want to move genes around? .
This is about moving genes around.
It's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones, our insistence on having bigger food, better food, singular food.
This isn't about Rice Krispies, this is about keeping people alive, and it's about time we started to understand what that meant.
Because, you know something? .
If we don't, if we continue to act the way we're acting, we're guilty of something that I don't think we want to be guilty of: high-tech colonialism.
There's no other way to describe what's going on here.
It's selfish, it's ugly, it's beneath us, and we really have to stop it.
So after this amazingly fun conversation, you might want to say, "So, you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go forward?" .
Absolutely.
It's stuck in the present right now, but we have an amazing opportunity.
We can set that time machine on anything we want.
We can move it where we want to move it, and we're going to move it where we want to move it.
We have to have these conversations and we have to think, but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead, we're going to be happy we do.
I know that we can, and as far as I'm concerned, that's something the world needs right now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
For some time I have been interested in the placebo effect, which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in, unless you think of it in the terms that I do, which is, "Something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real.
Something fake becomes something real because of someone's perception of it.
In order for us to understand each other, I want to start by showing you a rudimentary, very simple magic trick.
And I'm going to show you how it works.
I learned it myself from Cub Scout Magic in the 1970s.
I'll do it for you, and then I'll explain it.
And then I'll explain why I explained it.
So, here's what happens.
The knife, which you can examine; my hand, which you could examine.
I'm just going to hold the knife in my fist like this.
I'll get my sleeve back.
And to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve I'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here.
That way you can see that at no time can anything travel, as long as I'm squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleeve.
And the object of this is quite simple.
I'm going to open my hand, and hopefully, if all is well, my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife.
In fact it's held so tightly in place that I can shake it, and the knife does not come off.
Nothing goes up or down my sleeve, no trickery.
Ta-da! .
So, this is a trick that I often teach to young children that are interested in magic, because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this very -- even though it's a very simple trick methodologically.
Probably many of you in the room know this trick.
What happens is this.
I hold the knife in my hand.
I say I'm going to grab hold of my wrist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve, that is a lie.
The reason I'm holding onto my wrist is because that's actually the secret of the illusion.
In a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you, this finger right here, my index finger is just going to shift from where it is, to a position pointing out like this.
Nice one.
Someone who didn't have a childhood is out there.
So, it goes like this, from here, right.
And as I move around my finger shifts.
And we could talk about why this is deceptive, why you don't notice there are only three fingers down here, because the mind, and the way it processes information, it doesn't count, one, two, three.
But that's not really what this is about.
Obviously it's clinging there, not by animal magnetism, but by chicanery, my index finger being there.
And then when I close my finger, same thing, as I move back, this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger.
I take this hand away.
There is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors.
Now, what does that have to do with the placebo effect? .
I read a study a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open.
I'm not a doctor or a researcher, so this, to me, was an astonishing thing.
It turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill, that's like aspirin shaped -- it's just a round white pill -- it has some certain measurable effect.
But if you change the form that you give the placebo in, like you make a smaller pill, and color it blue, and stamp a letter into it, it is actually measurably more effective.
Even though neither one of these things has any pharmaceutical -- they're sugar pills.
But a white pill is not as good as a blue pill.
What? That really flipped me out.
Turns out though, that that's not even where it stops.
If you have capsules, they're more effective than tablets in any form.
A colored capsule, that's yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capsule.
Dosage has something to do with this.
One pill twice a day is not as good at three pills -- I don't remember the statistic now.
But the point is .
.
And the form has something to do with it.
And if you want the ultimate in placebo, you've go to the needle.
Right? A syringe with some inert -- a couple CCs of some inert something, and you inject this into a patient .
Well this is such a powerful image in their mind, it's so much stronger than the white pill.
It's a really, this graph, well I'll show it to you some other time when we have slides.
The point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle.
And none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality, it's only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect.
I wanted to see if I could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick.
And take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real.
And we know from that study that when you want reality, you go to the needle.
This is a seven-inch hatpin.
This is really my flesh.
That's my skin right there.
I'm going to pierce my skin and run this needle through to the other side.
If you're queasy -- if you faint easily -- I was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night, and some people that I didn't know, and one woman almost passed out.
So, I suggest if you get queasy easy that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact, you know what, I'll do the first bad part behind it.
You'll get to see, you can look away too if you'd like to.
So, here is what happens, right here, the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm I just make a little pierce.
I'm sorry, man.
OK, and then just through my skin a tiny bit, and then out the other side like this.
Now, essentially we're in the same position we were in with the knife trick.
Sort of.
But you can't count my fingers right now can you? .
So, let me show them to you.
Yes, well.
I know what people think when they see this.
They go, "Well, he's certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes.
So, let me give you a little peek.
How's that look out there? Pretty good.
Yeah, I know.
And the people in the back go, "OK, I didn't really see that.
People in the satellite room are starting to move in now.
Let me give you good close look at this.
That really is my skin.
That's my flesh, and I can twist that around.
I'm sorry.
People in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go, "Well yeah, that looks kind of neat in some sort of effect there, but if it were real he would be -- see there's a hole there and a hole there, if it were real he would be bleeding.
Well let me work up some blood for you.
Yes, there it is.
Normally now, I would take the needle out.
I would clean off my arm, and I would show you that there are no wounds.
But I think in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and making it into something real, I'm just going to leave it there, and walk off the stage.
I will be seeing you several times over the next few days.
I hope you're looking forward to that.
Everybody talks about happiness these days.
I had somebody count the number of books with "happiness" in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40, and there were many more.
There is a huge wave of interest in happiness, among researchers.
There is a lot of happiness coaching.
Everybody would like to make people happier.
But in spite of all this flood of work, there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness.
And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps.
This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness, and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness, because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else is.
The first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity.
It turns out that the word "happiness" is just not a useful word anymore, because we apply it to too many different things.
I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it, but by and large, this is something that we'll have to give up and we'll have to adopt the more complicated view of what well-being is.
The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory; basically, it's between being happy in your life, and being happy about your life or happy with your life.
And those are two very different concepts, and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness.
And the third is the focusing illusion, and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance that affects well-being without distorting its importance.
I mean, this is a real cognitive trap.
There's just no way of getting it right.
And then he added, really quite emotionally, it ruined the whole experience.
But it hadn't.
What it had ruined were the memories of the experience.
He had had the experience.
He had had 20 minutes of glorious music.
They counted for nothing because he was left with a memory; the memory was ruined, and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep.
What this is telling us, really, is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves.
There is an experiencing self, who lives in the present and knows the present, is capable of re-living the past, but basically it has only the present.
It's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches -- you know, when the doctor asks, "Does it hurt now when I touch you here?" .
And then there is a remembering self, and the remembering self is the one that keeps score, and maintains the story of our life, and it's the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question, "How have you been feeling lately?" .
or "How was your trip to Albania?" or something like that.
Those are two very different entities, the experiencing self and the remembering self, and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness.
Now, the remembering self is a storyteller.
And that really starts with a basic response of our memories -- it starts immediately.
We don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories.
Our memory tells us stories, that is, what we get to keep from our experiences is a story.
And let me begin with one example.
This is an old study.
Those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure.
I won't go into detail.
They were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds.
Here are two patients, those are their recordings.
And you are asked, "Who of them suffered more?" .
And it's a very easy question.
Clearly, Patient B suffered more -- his colonoscopy was longer, and every minute of pain that Patient A had, Patient B had, and more.
But now there is another question: "How much did these patients think they suffered?" .
And here is a surprise.
The surprise is that Patient A had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy than Patient B.
The stories of the colonoscopies were different, and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends.
And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great -- but one of them is this distinct .
but one of them is distinctly worse than the other.
And the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end; it's a bad story.
How do we know that? .
Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy, and much later, too, "How bad was the whole thing, in total?" .
And it was much worse for A than for B, in memory.
Now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self.
From the point of view of the experiencing self, clearly, B had a worse time.
Now, what you could do with Patient A, and we actually ran clinical experiments, and it has been done, and it does work -- you could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much.
That will cause the patient to suffer, but just a little and much less than before.
And if you do that for a couple of minutes, you have made the experiencing self of Patient A worse off, and you have the remembering self of Patient A a lot better off, because now you have endowed Patient A with a better story about his experience.
What defines a story? .
And that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us, and it's also true of the stories that we make up.
What defines a story are changes, significant moments and endings.
Endings are very, very important and, in this case, the ending dominated.
Now, the experiencing self lives its life continuously.
It has moments of experience, one after the other.
And you can ask: What happens to these moments? .
And the answer is really straightforward: They are lost forever.
Most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self.
And yet, somehow you get the sense that they should count, that what happens during these moments of experience is our life.
It's the finite resource that we're spending while we're on this earth.
And how to spend it would seem to be relevant, but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us.
So we have the remembering self and the experiencing self, and they're really quite distinct.
The biggest difference between them is in the handling of time.
From the point of view of the experiencing self, if you have a vacation, and the second week is just as good as the first, then the two-week vacation is twice as good as the one-week vacation.
That's not the way it works at all for the remembering self.
For the remembering self, a two-week vacation is barely better than the one-week vacation because there are no new memories added.
You have not changed the story.
And in this way, time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self; time has very little impact on the story.
Now, the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories.
The experiencing self has no voice in this choice.
We actually don't choose between experiences, we choose between memories of experiences.
And even when we think about the future, we don't think of our future normally as experiences.
We think of our future as anticipated memories.
And basically you can look at this, you know, as a tyranny of the remembering self, and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn't need.
I have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case; that is, we go on vacations, to a very large extent, in the service of our remembering self.
And this is a bit hard to justify I think.
I mean, how much do we consume our memories? .
That is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the remembering self.
And when I think about that, I think about a vacation we had in Antarctica a few years ago, which was clearly the best vacation I've ever had, and I think of it relatively often, relative to how much I think of other vacations.
And I probably have consumed my memories of that three-week trip, I would say, for about 25 minutes in the last four years.
Now, if I had ever opened the folder with the 600 pictures in it, I would have spent another hour.
Now, that is three weeks, and that is at most an hour and a half.
There seems to be a discrepancy.
Now, I may be a bit extreme, you know, in how little appetite I have for consuming memories, but even if you do more of this, there is a genuine question: Why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences? .
So I want you to think about a thought experiment.
Imagine that for your next vacation, you know that at the end of the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed, and you'll get an amnesic drug so that you won't remember anything.
Now, would you choose the same vacation? .
Why do we pick the vacations we do is a problem that confronts us with a choice between the two selves.
Now, the two selves bring up two notions of happiness.
There are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply, one per self.
So you can ask: How happy is the experiencing self? .
And then you would ask: How happy are the moments in the experiencing self's life? .
And they're all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process.
What are the emotions that can be measured? .
And, by the way, now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time.
If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self, it's a completely different thing.
This is not about how happily a person lives.
It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life.
Very different notion.
Anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions is going to mess up the study of happiness, and I belong to a crowd of students of well-being, who've been messing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way.
The distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years, and there are now efforts to measure the two separately.
The Gallup Organization has a world poll where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences, and there have been other efforts along those lines.
So in recent years, we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves.
And the main lesson I think that we have learned is they are really different.
You can know how satisfied somebody is with their life, and that really doesn't teach you much about how happily they're living their life, and vice versa.
Just to give you a sense of the correlation, the correlation is about .
What that means is if you met somebody, and you were told, "Oh his father is six feet tall," how much would you know about his height? .
Well, you would know something about his height, but there's a lot of uncertainty.
You have that much uncertainty.
If I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten, you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self.
So the correlation is low.
We know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self.
We know that money is very important, goals are very important.
We know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like, spending time with people that we like.
There are other pleasures, but this is dominant.
So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves, you are going to end up doing very different things.
The bottom line of what I've said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well-being.
It is a completely different notion.
Now, very quickly, another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life, and we actually live.
So, if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California, you are not going to get to the correct answer.
When you ask that question, you think people must be happier in California if, say, you live in Ohio.
And what happens is when you think about living in California, you are thinking of the contrast between California and other places, and that contrast, say, is in climate.
Well, it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and it's not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are.
But now, because the reflective self is in charge, you may end up -- some people may end up moving to California.
And it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier.
Well, their experiencing self is not going to get happier.
We know that.
But one thing will happen: They will think they are happier, because, when they think about it, they'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio, and they will feel they made the right decision.
It is very difficult to think straight about well-being, and I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Now, when we were on the phone a few weeks ago, you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that Gallup survey.
Is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now? .
Daniel Kahneman: Sure.
I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey is a number, which we absolutely did not expect to find.
We found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self.
When we looked at how feelings, vary with income.
And it turns out that, below an income of 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans -- and that's a very large sample of Americans, like 600,000, so it's a large representative sample -- below an income of 600,000 dollars a year.
60,000.
DK: 60,000.
60,000 dollars a year, people are unhappy, and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get.
Above that, we get an absolutely flat line.
I mean I've rarely seen lines so flat.
Clearly, what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness, but lack of money certainly buys you misery, and we can measure that misery very, very clearly.
In terms of the other self, the remembering self, you get a different story.
The more money you earn, the more satisfied you are.
That does not hold for emotions.
But Danny, the whole American endeavor is about life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.
If people took seriously that finding, I mean, it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about, like for example, taxation policy and so forth.
Is there any chance that politicians, that the country generally, would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it? .
DK: You know I think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy.
The recognition is going to be slow in the United States, no question about that, but in the U.
People are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy.
It's going to take a while, and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness, or whether they want to study life evaluation, so we need to have that debate fairly soon.
How to enhance happiness goes very different ways depending on how you think, and whether you think of the remembering self or you think of the experiencing self.
This is going to influence policy, I think, in years to come.
In the United States, efforts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population.
This is going to be, I think, within the next decade or two, part of national statistics.
Well, it seems to me that this issue will -- or at least should be -- the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years.
Thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics.
Thank you, Danny Kahneman.
I'm Jane McGonigal.
I've been making games online now for 10 years, and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games.
Now, I have a plan for this, and it entails convincing more people, including all of you, to spend more time playing bigger and better games.
Right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games.
Some of you might be thinking, "That's a lot of time to spend playing games.
Maybe too much time, considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world.
But actually, according to my research at The Institute For The Future, it's actually the opposite is true.
Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world's most urgent problems.
In fact, I believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet, we need to increase that total dramatically.
I've calculated the total we need at 21 billion hours of game play every week.
No.
Here's why.
This is a portrait by a photographer named Phil Toledano.
He wanted to capture the emotion of gaming, so he set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing.
And this is a classic gaming emotion.
Now, if you're not a gamer, you might miss some of the nuance in this photo.
You probably see the sense of urgency, a little bit of fear, but intense concentration, deep, deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem.
If you are a gamer, you will notice a few nuances here: the crinkle of the eyes up, and around the mouth is a sign of optimism, and the eyebrows up is surprise.
This is a gamer who is on the verge of something called an epic win.
Oh, you've heard of that.
An epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it.
It was almost beyond the threshold of imagination.
And when you get there you are shocked to discover what you are truly capable of.
This is a gamer on the verge of an epic win.
And this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem-solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century -- the face of someone who, against all odds is on the verge of an epic win.
Now, unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems.
This is what I call the "I'm Not Good At Life" face, and this is actually me making it.
This is actually me making the "I'm Not Good At Life" face.
This is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeley, California, where I did my PhD on why we're better in games than we are in real life.
And this is a problem that a lot of gamers have.
We feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games.
And I don't mean just good as in successful, although that's part of it.
We do achieve more in game worlds.
And when we're in game worlds I believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves, the most likely to help at a moment's notice, the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes, to get up after failure and try again.
And in real life, when we face failure, when we confront obstacles, we often don't feel that way.
We feel overcome, we feel overwhelmed, we feel anxious, maybe depressed, frustrated or cynical.
We never have those feelings when we're playing games, they just don't exist in games.
So, that's what I wanted to study when I was a graduate student.
What about games makes it impossible to feel that we can't achieve everything? .
How can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real-world work? .
So, I looked at games like World of Warcraft, which is really the ideal collaborative problem-solving environment.
And I started to notice a few things that make epic wins so possible in online worlds.
So, the first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games, especially in World of Warcraft, there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world-saving mission, right away.
But not just any mission, it's a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game.
So, you can do it.
They never give you a challenge that you can't achieve.
But it is on the verge of what you're capable of.
There is no sitting around wringing your hands, there's always something specific and important to be done.
And there are also tons of collaborators.
Everywhere you go, hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission.
That's not something that we have in real life that easily, this sense that at our fingertips are tons of collaborators.
And also there is this epic story, this inspiring story of why we're there, and what we're doing.
And then we get all this positive feedback.
You guys have heard of leveling up and plus-one strength, and plus-one intelligence.
We don't get that kind of constant feedback in real life.
When I get off this stage I'm not going to have plus-one speaking, and plus-one crazy idea, plus-20 crazy idea.
I don't get that feedback in real life.
Now, the problem with collaborative online environments like World of Warcraft is that it's so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic win all the time that we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds.
It's just better than reality.
So, so far, collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers have spent 5.
Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing.
It might sound like it's a bad thing.
But to put that in context: 5.
That was the first upright primate.
Okay, so when we talk about how much time we're currently investing in playing games, the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution, which is an extraordinary thing.
But it's also apt.
We are evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species.
This is true.
So, consider this really interesting statistic; it was recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University: The average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games by the age of 21.
Now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons.
People were suffering.
It was an extreme situation, they needed an extreme solution.
So, according to Herodotus, they invented dice games and they set up a kingdom-wide policy: On one day, everybody would eat, and on the next day, everybody would play games.
And they would be so immersed in playing the dice games because games are so engaging, and immerse us in such satisfying blissful productivity, they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat.
And then on the next day, they would play games; and on the next day, they would eat.
And according to Herodotus, they passed 18 years this way, surviving through a famine by eating on one day and playing games on the next.
Now, this is exactly, I think, how we're using games today.
We're using games to escape real-world suffering.
We're using games to get away from everything that's broken in the real environment, everything that's not satisfying about real life, and we're getting what we need from games.
But it doesn't have to end there.
This is really exciting.
According to Herodotus, after 18 years the famine wasn't getting better, so the king decided they would play one final dice game.
They divided the entire kingdom in half.
They played one dice game, and the winners of that game got to go on an epic adventure.
They would leave Lydia, and they would go out in search of a new place to live, leaving behind just enough people to survive on the resources that were available, and hopefully to take their civilization somewhere else where they could thrive.
Now, this sounds crazy, right? .
But recently, DNA evidence has shown that the Etruscans, who then led to the Roman Empire, actually share the same DNA as the ancient Lydians.
And so, recently, scientists have suggested that Herodotus' crazy story is actually true.
And geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted for nearly 20 years that could have explained the famine.
So, this crazy story might be true.
They might have actually saved their culture by playing games, escaping to games for 18 years, and then been so inspired, and knew so much about how to come together with games, that they actually saved the entire civilization that way.
Okay, we can do that.
We've been playing Warcraft since 1994.
That was the first real-time strategy game from the World of Warcraft series.
They played dice games for 18 years, we've been playing Warcraft for 16 years.
I say we are ready for our own epic game.
Now, they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world, so that's where I get my 21 billion hours a week of game-play from.
Let's get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games, until we solve real-world problems.
Now, I know you're asking, "How are we going to solve real world problems in games?" Well, that's what I have devoted my work to over the past few years, at The Institute For The Future.
We have this banner in our offices in Palo Alto, and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future.
We do not want to try to predict the future.
What we want to do is make the future.
We want to imagine the best-case scenario outcome, and then we want to empower people to make that outcome a reality.
We want to imagine epic wins, and then give people the means to achieve the epic win.
I'm just going to very briefly show you three games that I've made that are an attempt to give people the means to create epic wins in their own futures.
So, this is World Without Oil.
We made this game in 2007.
This is an online game in which you try to survive an oil shortage.
We piloted this game with 1,700 players in 2007, and we've tracked them for the three years since.
And I can tell you that this is a transformative experience.
Nobody wants to change how they live just because it's good for the world, or because we're supposed to.
But if you immerse them in an epic adventure and tell them, "We've run out of oil.
This is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on.
Challenge yourself to see how you would survive," most of our players have kept up the habits that they learned in this game.
So, for the next world-saving game, we decided to aim higher: bigger problem than just peak oil.
We did a game called Superstruct at The Institute For The Future.
And the premise was a supercomputer has calculated that humans have only 23 years left on the planet.
This supercomputer was called the Global Extinction Awareness System, of course.
We asked people to come online almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie.
You know Jerry Bruckheimer movies, you form a dream team -- you've got the astronaut, the scientist, the ex-convict, and they all have something to do to save the world.
But in our game, instead of just having five people on the dream team, we said, "Everybody's on the dream team, and it's your job to invent the future of energy, the future of food, the future of health, the future of security and the future of the social safety net.
We had 8,000 people play that game for eight weeks.
They came up with 500 insanely creative solutions that you can go online, if you Google "Superstruct," and see.
So, finally, the last game, we're launching it March 3rd.
If you complete the game you will be certified by the World Bank Institute, as a Social Innovator, class of 2010.
Working with universities all over sub-Saharan Africa, and we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills.
We've got a graphic novel, we've got leveling up in skills like local insight, knowledge networking, sustainability, vision and resourcefulness.
I would like to invite all of you to please share this game with young people, anywhere in the world, particularly in developing areas, who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world.
So, I'm going to wrap up now.
I want to ask a question.
What do you think happens next? .
We've got all these amazing gamers, we've got these games that are kind of pilots of what we might do, but none of them have saved the real world yet.
Well I hope that you will agree with me that gamers are a human resource that we can use to do real-world work, that games are a powerful platform for change.
We have all these amazing superpowers: blissful productivity, the ability to weave a tight social fabric, this feeling of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning.
I really hope that we can come together to play games that matter, to survive on this planet for another century.
And that's my hope, that you will join me in making and playing games like this.
When I look forward to the next decade, I know two things for sure: that we can make any future we can imagine, and we can play any games we want.
So, I say: Let the world-changing games begin.
Thank you.
I'd like to share with you a discovery that I made a few months ago while writing an article for Italian Wired.
I always keep my thesaurus handy whenever I'm writing anything, but I'd already finished editing the piece, and I realized that I had never once in my life looked up the word "disabled" to see what I'd find.
Let me read you the entry.
Antonyms, healthy, strong, capable.
You know, of course, this is my raggedy old thesaurus so I'm thinking this must be an ancient print date, right? .
But, in fact, the print date was the early 1980s, when I would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me.
And, needless to say, thank God I wasn't using a thesaurus back then.
I mean, from this entry, it would seem that I was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them, when in fact, today I'm celebrated for the opportunities and adventures my life has procured.
So, I immediately went to look up the 2009 online edition, expecting to find a revision worth noting.
Here's the updated version of this entry.
Unfortunately, it's not much better.
I find the last two words under "Near Antonyms," particularly unsettling: "whole" and "wholesome.
So, it's not just about the words.
It's what we believe about people when we name them with these words.
It's about the values behind the words, and how we construct those values.
Our language affects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people.
In fact, many ancient societies, including the Greeks and the Romans, believed that to utter a curse verbally was so powerful, because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence.
So, what reality do we want to call into existence: a person who is limited, or a person who's empowered? .
By casually doing something as simple as naming a person, a child, we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power.
Wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead? .
One such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the A.
His name was Dr.
And Dr.
I loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital, with the exception of my physical therapy sessions.
And, you know, I was already bargaining, as a five year-old child, with Dr.
And, one day, he came in to my session -- exhaustive and unforgiving, these sessions -- and he said to me, "Wow.
When you do break it, I'm going to give you a hundred bucks.
And I have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong, powerful and athletic person well into the future.
This is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child.
But, in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries, our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want, the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable.
Our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society, many of which have been brought about by technology.
So, perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth: that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society, and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset.
But, in fact, we are changed.
And I'm going to suggest that this is a good thing.
Adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life.
It's part of our life.
And I tend to think of it like my shadow.
Sometimes I see a lot of it, sometimes there's very little, but it's always with me.
And, certainly, I'm not trying to diminish the impact, the weight, of a person's struggle.
There is adversity and challenge in life, and it's all very real and relative to every single person, but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity, but how you're going to meet it.
So, our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity, but preparing them to meet it well.
And we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt.
There's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not I'm disabled.
And, truthfully, the only real and consistent disability I've had to confront is the world ever thinking that I could be described by those definitions.
Perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it, serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself.
By not treating the wholeness of a person, by not acknowledging their potency, we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have.
We are effectively grading someone's worth to our community.
So we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability.
And, most importantly, there's a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability.
So it's not about devaluing, or negating, these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug, but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity.
So maybe the idea I want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it, embracing it, grappling with it, to use a wrestling term, maybe even dancing with it.
And, perhaps, if we see adversity as natural, consistent and useful, we're less burdened by the presence of it.
This year we celebrate the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin, and it was 150 years ago, when writing about evolution, that Darwin illustrated, I think, a truth about the human character.
To paraphrase: It's not the strongest of the species that survives, nor is it the most intelligent that survives; it is the one that is most adaptable to change.
Conflict is the genesis of creation.
From Darwin's work, amongst others, we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation.
So, again, transformation, adaptation, is our greatest human skill.
And, perhaps, until we're tested, we don't know what we're made of.
Maybe that's what adversity gives us: a sense of self, a sense of our own power.
So, we can give ourselves a gift.
We can re-imagine adversity as something more than just tough times.
Maybe we can see it as change.
Adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet.
I think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy.
Now, who's normal? .
There's no normal.
There's common, there's typical.
I don't think so.
Anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use, to be able to contribute.
There's evidence that Neanderthals, 60,000 years ago, carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury, and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community.
They didn't view these people as broken and useless; they were seen as rare and valuable.
A few years ago, I was in a food market in the town where I grew up in that red zone in northeastern Pennsylvania, and I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes.
It was summertime: I had shorts on.
I hear this guy, his voice behind me say, "Well, if it isn't Aimee Mullins.
And I turn around, and it's this older man.
And I said, "I'm sorry, sir, have we met? I don't remember meeting you.
He said, "Well, you wouldn't remember meeting me.
I mean, when we met I was delivering you from your mother's womb.
Oh, that guy.
And, but of course, actually, it did click.
This man was Dr.
And so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation, so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents.
And, because I was born without the fibula bones, and had feet turned in, and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that, he had to be the bearer -- this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news.
He said to me, "I had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk, and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence, and you've been making liar out of me ever since.
And he called this part of the course the X Factor, the potential of the human will.
No prognosis can account for how powerful this could be as a determinant in the quality of someone's life.
And Dr.
See, Dr.
He understood that there's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it.
And there's been a shift in my thinking over time, in that, if you had asked me at 15 years old, if I would have traded prosthetics for flesh-and-bone legs, I wouldn't have hesitated for a second.
I aspired to that kind of normalcy back then.
But if you ask me today, I'm not so sure.
And it's because of the experiences I've had with them, not in spite of the experiences I've had with them.
And perhaps this shift in me has happened because I've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me.
See, all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power, and you're off.
If you can hand somebody the key to their own power -- the human spirit is so receptive -- if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment, you are educating them in the best sense.
You're teaching them to open doors for themselves.
In fact, the exact meaning of the word "educate" comes from the root word "educe.
It means "to bring forth what is within, to bring out potential.
So again, which potential do we want to bring out? .
There was a case study done in 1960s Britain, when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools.
It's called the streaming trials.
It's separating students from A, B, C, D and so on.
And the "A students" get the tougher curriculum, the best teachers, etc.
Well, they took, over a three-month period, D-level students, gave them A's, told them they were "A's," told them they were bright, and at the end of this three-month period, they were performing at A-level.
And, of course, the heartbreaking, flip side of this study, is that they took the "A students" and told them they were "D's.
And that's what happened at the end of that three-month period.
Those who were still around in school, besides the people who had dropped out.
A crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too.
The teachers didn't know a switch had been made.
They were simply told, "These are the 'A-students,' these are the 'D-students.
So, I think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit, a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope, it doesn't see beauty, it no longer has our natural, childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine.
If instead, we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope, to see beauty in themselves and others, to be curious and imaginative, then we are truly using our power well.
When a spirit has those qualities, we are able to create new realities and new ways of being.
Come, dance with me.
How would you like to be better than you are? .
Suppose I said that, with just a few changes in your genes, you could get a better memory -- more precise, more accurate and quicker.
Or maybe you'd like to be more fit, stronger, with more stamina.
Would you like to be more attractive and self-confident? .
How about living longer with good health? .
Or perhaps you're one of those who's always yearned for more creativity.
Which one would you like the most? .
Which would you like, if you could have just one? .
Creativity.
How many people would choose creativity? .
Raise your hands.
A few.
That's very good.
How many would opt for memory? .
Quite a few more.
How about fitness? .
A few less.
What about longevity? .
Ah, the majority.
If you could have any one of these, it would be a very different world.
Is it just imaginary? .
Or, is it, perhaps, possible? .
Evolution has been a perennial topic here at the TED Conference, but I want to give you today one doctor's take on the subject.
The great 20th-century geneticist, T.
But if you do accept biological evolution, consider this: is it just about the past, or is it about the future? .
Does it apply to others, or does it apply to us? .
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, way out on one end, is, of course, the one that we are most interested in.
We branch off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
In the interval, there have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of hominids.
Some have come and gone.
We have been here for about 130,000 years.
It may seem like we're quite remote from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, for the most part, the basic machinery of our cells is pretty much the same.
Do you realize that we can take advantage and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin used to treat diabetics? .
This is not like human insulin; this is the same protein that is chemically indistinguishable from what comes out of your pancreas.
And speaking of bacteria, do you realize that each of us carries in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body? .
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean think of it, when Antonio Damasio asks about your self-image, do you think about the bacteria? .
Our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria.
It's warm, it's dark, it's moist, it's very cozy.
And you're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part.
It's really like an Easy Street for bacteria, with the occasional interruption of the unintended forced rush to the exit.
But otherwise, you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria, just as they are essential to your life.
They help in the digestion of essential nutrients, and they protect you against certain diseases.
But what will come in the future? .
Are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise as a species? .
Or, are we destined to become something different -- something, perhaps, even better adapted to the environment? .
In this vast unfinished symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief measure; the animal kingdom, like a single measure; and human life, a small grace note.
That was us.
That also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk, so I hope you enjoyed it.
Now when I was a freshman in college, I took my first biology class.
I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology.
I became enamored of the power of evolution, and I realized something very fundamental: in most of the existence of life in single-celled organisms, each cell simply divides, and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells.
But at the time multi-celled organisms come online, things start to change.
Sexual reproduction enters the picture.
And very importantly, with the introduction of sexual reproduction that passes on the genome, the rest of the body becomes expendable.
In fact, you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction.
Now I have to confess, when I was a college undergraduate, I thought, okay, sex/death, sex/death, death for sex -- it seemed pretty reasonable at the time, but with each passing year, I've come to have increasing doubts.
I've come to understand the sentiments of George Burns, who was performing still in Las Vegas well into his 90s.
And one night, there's a knock at his hotel room door.
He answers the door.
Standing before him is a gorgeous, scantily clad showgirl.
She looks at him and says, "I'm here for super sex.
"That's fine," says George, "I'll take the soup.
I came to realize, as a physician, that I was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution -- not necessarily contradictory, just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to keep us healthy.
I wanted to restore health from disease.
I wanted us to live long and healthy lives.
Evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation, adapting and surviving through generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like the booster rockets designed to send the genetic payload into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea.
I think we would all understand the sentiment that Woody Allen expressed when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to achieve it through not dying.
Evolution does not necessarily favor the longest-lived.
It doesn't necessarily favor the biggest or the strongest or the fastest, and not even the smartest.
Evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment.
That is the sole test of survival and success.
At the bottom of the ocean, bacteria that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce, if fish were there, sous-vide cooked fish, nevertheless, have managed to make that a hospitable environment for them.
So what does this mean, as we look back at what has happened in evolution, and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution, and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase, I would say that there are a number of possibilities.
The first is that we will not evolve.
We have reached a kind of equipoise.
And the reasoning behind that would be, first, we have, through medicine, managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population.
And secondly, we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, we immigrate and circulate and intermix so much that you can't any longer have the isolation that is necessary for evolution to take place.
A second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind, natural, imposed by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution grind slowly, but they are inexorable.
And as far as isolation goes, when we as a species do colonize distant planets, there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way.
But there's a third possibility, an enticing, intriguing and frightening possibility.
I call it neo-evolution -- the new evolution that is not simply natural, but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make.
Now how could this come about? .
How could it be possible that we would do this? .
Consider, first, the reality that people today, in some cultures, are making choices about their offspring.
They're, in some cultures, choosing to have more males than females.
It's not necessarily good for the society, but it's what the individual and the family are choosing.
Think also, if it were possible ever for you to choose, not simply to choose the sex of your child, but for you in your body to make the genetic adjustments that would cure or prevent diseases.
What if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke? .
Wouldn't you want to make those changes in your genes? .
If we look ahead, these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990, and it took 13 years.
It cost 2.
The year after it was finished in 2004, you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months.
Today, you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about 20,000 dollars and in the space of about a week.
It won't be very long before the reality will be the 1,000-dollar human genome, and it will be increasingly available for everyone.
These changes are coming.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves, but induce immunity against other viruses.
Believe it or not, there's an experimental trial going on with vaccine against influenza that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco? .
These are all reality today, and [in] the future, will be evermore possible.
Imagine then just two other little changes.
You can change the cells in your body, but what if you could change the cells in your offspring? .
What if you could change the sperm and the ova, or change the newly fertilized egg, and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life -- eliminate the diabetes, eliminate the hemophilia, reduce the risk of cancer? .
Who doesn't want healthier children? .
And then, that same analytic technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease, will also enable us to adopt super-attributes, hyper-capacities -- that better memory.
Why not have the quick wit of a Ken Jennings, especially if you can augment it with the next generation of the Watson machine? .
Why not have the quick twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer? .
Why not live longer? .
These will be irresistible.
And when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation, and we can adopt the attributes we want, we will have converted old-style evolution into neo-evolution.
We'll take a process that normally might require 100,000 years, and we can compress it down to a thousand years -- and maybe even in the next 100 years.
These are choices that your grandchildren, or their grandchildren, are going to have before them.
Will we use these choices to make a society that is better, that is more successful, that is kinder? .
Or, will we selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others of us? .
Will we make a society that is more boring and more uniform, or more robust and more versatile? .
These are the kinds of questions that we will have to face.
And most profoundly of all, will we ever be able to develop the wisdom, and to inherit the wisdom, that we'll need to make these choices wisely? .
For better or worse, and sooner than you may think, these choices will be up to us.
Thank you.
I want you now to imagine a wearable robot that gives you superhuman abilities, or another one that takes wheelchair users up standing and walking again.
We at Berkeley Bionics call these robots exoskeletons.
These are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning, and it will give you extra strength, and it will further enhance your speed, and it will help you, for instance, to manage your balance.
It is actually the true integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- it will integrate and network you to the universe and other devices out there.
This is just not some blue sky thinking.
To show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the American soldier, that on average does carry about 100 lbs.
Obviously, this is resulting in some major complications -- back injuries, 30 percent of them -- chronic back injuries.
So we thought we would look at this challenge and create an exoskeleton that would help deal with this issue.
So let me now introduce to you HULC -- or the Human Universal Load Carrier.
With the HULC exoskeleton, I can carry 200 lbs.
Its flexible design allows for deep squats, crawls and high-agility movements.
It senses what I want to do, where I want to go, and then augments my strength and endurance.
We are ready with our industry partner to introduce this device, this new exoskeleton this year.
So this is for real.
Now let's turn our heads towards the wheelchair users, something that I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people estimated to be in wheelchairs worldwide.
This is about one percent of the total population.
And that's actually a conservative estimate.
We are talking here about, oftentimes, very young individuals with spinal cord injuries, that in the prime of their life -- 20s, 30s, 40s -- hit a wall and the wheelchair's the only option.
But it is also the aging population that is multiplying in numbers.
And the only option, pretty much -- when it's stroke or other complications -- is the wheelchair.
And that is actually for the last 500 years, since its very successful introduction, I must say.
So we thought we would start writing a brand new chapter of mobility.
Let me now introduce you to eLEGS that is worn by Amanda Boxtel that 19 years ago was spinal cord injured, and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for 19 years until now.
Thank you.
Amanda is wearing our eLEGS set.
It has sensors.
It's completely non-invasive, sensors in the crutches that send signals back to our onboard computer that is sitting here at her back.
There are battery packs here as well that power motors that are sitting at her hips, as well as her knee joints, that move her forward in this kind of smooth and very natural gait.
I was 24 years old and at the top of my game when a freak summersault while downhill skiing paralyzed me.
In a split second, I lost all sensation and movement below my pelvis.
Not long afterwards, a doctor strode into my hospital room, and he said, "Amanda, you'll never walk again.
And that was 19 yeas ago.
He robbed every ounce of hope from my being.
Adaptive technology has since enabled me to learn how to downhill ski again, to rock climb and even handcycle.
But nothing has been invented that enables me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit down and have discussions with you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations -- not only for the soldiers, or for Amanda here and all the wheelchair users, but for everyone.
Thanks.
Back in New York, I am the head of development for a non-profit called Robin Hood.
When I'm not fighting poverty, I'm fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company.
Now in our town, where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff, you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the scene, so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in.
But still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge to find out what our assignments would be.
When I found the captain, he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner, who was surely having one of the worst days of her life.
Here it was, the middle of the night, she was standing outside in the pouring rain, under an umbrella, in her pajamas, barefoot, while her house was in flames.
The other volunteer who had arrived just before me -- let's call him Lex Luther -- got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner's dog.
The dog! I was stunned with jealousy.
Here was some lawyer or money manager who, for the rest of his life, gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature, just because he beat me by five seconds.
Well, I was next.
The captain waved me over.
He said, "Bezos, I need you to go into the house.
I need you to go upstairs, past the fire, and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes.
I swear.
So, not exactly what I was hoping for, but off I went -- up the stairs, down the hall, past the 'real' firefighters, who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point, into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes.
Now I know what you're thinking, but I'm no hero.
I carried my payload back downstairs where I met my nemesis and the precious dog by the front door.
We took our treasures outside to the homeowner, where, not surprisingly, his received much more attention than did mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the homeowner thanking us for the valiant effort displayed in saving her home.
The act of kindness she noted above all others: someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes.
In both my vocation at Robin Hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter, I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale, but I'm also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis.
And you know what I've learned? .
They all matter.
So as I look around this room at people who either have achieved, or are on their way to achieving, remarkable levels of success, I would offer this reminder: don't wait.
Don't wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, give it now.
Serve food at a soup kitchen.
Be a mentor.
Not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody's life, but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one.
So get in the game.
Thank you.
Mark, Mark, come back.
Thank you.
I just came back from a community that holds the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women run the show, have sex to say hello, and play rules the day -- where fun is serious business.
And no, this isn't Burning Man or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet your cousins.
This is the world of wild bonobos in the jungles of Congo.
Bonobos are, together with chimpanzees, your living closest relative.
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived around six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are well-known for their aggression.
But unfortunately, we have made too much of an emphasis of this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
While chimpanzees are dominated by big, scary guys, bonobo society is run by empowered females.
These guys have really worked something out, since this leads to a highly tolerant society where fatal violence has not been observed yet.
But unfortunately, bonobos are the least understood of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the Congolese jungle, and it has been very difficult to study them.
The Congo is a paradox -- a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of darkness itself -- the scene of a violent conflict that has raged for decades and claimed nearly as many lives as the First World War.
Not surprisingly, this destruction also endangers bonobo survival.
Bushmeat trades and forest loss means we couldn't fill a small stadium with all the bonobos that are left in the world -- and we're not even sure of that to be honest.
Yet, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear hidden laughter swaying the trees.
Who are these cousins? .
We know them as the "make love, not war" apes since they have frequent, promiscuous and bisexual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues.
Now, I'm not saying this is the solution to all of humanity's problems -- since there's more to bonobo life than the Kama Sutra.
Bonobos, like humans, love to play throughout their entire lives.
Play is not just child's games.
For us and them, play is foundational for bonding relationships and fostering tolerance.
It's where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game.
Play increases creativity and resilience, and it's all about the generation of diversity -- diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections.
And when you watch bonobo play, you're seeing the very evolutionary roots of human laughter, dance and ritual.
Play is the glue that binds us together.
Now, I don't know how you play, but I want to show you a couple of unique clips fresh from the wild.
First, it's a ball game bonobo-style -- and I do not mean football.
So here, we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game.
Have a look what she's doing.
It might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "she's got him by the balls.
Only I think that he's rather loving it here, right? .
Yeah.
So sex play is common in both bonobos and humans.
But play's a shapeshifter.
Play's a shapeshifter, and it can take many forms, some of which are more quiet, imaginative, curious -- maybe where wonder is discovered anew.
And I want you to see, this is Fuku, a young female, and she is quietly playing with water.
I think, like her, we sometimes play alone, and we explore the boundaries of our inner and our outer worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, drives us to interact, and then the unexpected connections we form are the real hotbed for creativity.
So these are just small tasters into the insights that bonobo give us to our past and present.
But they also hold a secret for our future, a future where we need to adapt to an increasingly challenging world through greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capacities.
In other words, play is our adaptive wildcard.
In order to adapt successfully to a changing world, we need to play.
But will we make the most of our playfulness? .
Play is not frivolous.
Play's essential.
For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just red in tooth and claw.
In times when it seems least appropriate to play, it might be the times when it is most urgent.
And so, my fellow primates, let us embrace this gift from evolution and play together, as we rediscover creativity, fellowship and wonder.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day, at the exact same moment, each conceiving a baby -- okay? .
So two couples each conceiving one baby.
Now I don't want you to spend too much time imagining the conception, because if you spend all that time imagining that conception, you're not going to listen to me.
So just imagine that for a moment.
And in this scenario, I want to imagine that, in one case, the sperm is carrying a Y chromosome, meeting that X chromosome of the egg.
And in the other case, the sperm is carrying an X chromosome, meeting the X chromosome of the egg.
Both are viable; both take off.
We'll come back to these people later.
So I wear two hats in most of what I do.
As the one hat, I do history of anatomy.
I'm a historian by training, and what I study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy -- meaning human bodies, animal bodies -- how they dealt with bodily fluids, concepts of bodies; how have they thought about bodies.
The other hat that I've worn in my work is as an activist, as a patient advocate -- or, as I sometimes say, as an impatient advocate -- for people who are patients of doctors.
In that case, what I've worked with is people who have body types that challenge social norms.
So some of what I've worked on, for example, is people who are conjoined twins -- two people within one body.
Some of what I've worked on is people who have dwarfism -- so people who are much shorter than typical.
And a lot of what I've worked on is people who have atypical sex -- so people who don't have the standard male or the standard female body types.
And as a general term, we can use the term intersex for this.
Intersex comes in a lot of different forms.
I'll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex that isn't standard for male or female.
So in one instance, you can have somebody who has an XY chromosomal basis, and that SRY gene on the Y chromosome tells the proto-gonads, which we all have in the fetal life, to become testes.
And so in the fetal life the testes are pumping out testosterone.
But because this individual lacks receptors to hear that testosterone, the body doesn't react to the testosterone.
And this is a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
So lots of levels of testosterone, but no reaction to it.
As a consequence, the body develops more along the female typical path.
When the child is born, she looks like a girl.
She is a girl.
And it's often not until she hits puberty and she's growing and developing breasts, but she's not getting her period, that somebody figures out something's up here.
And they do some tests and figure out that, instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus, she actually has testes inside, and she has a Y chromosome.
Now what's important to understand is you may think of this person as really being male, but they're really not.
Females, like males, have in our bodies something called the adrenal glands.
They're in the back of our body.
And the adrenal glands make androgens, which are a masculinizing hormone.
Most females like me -- I believe myself to be a typical female -- I don't actually know my chromosomal make-up but I think I'm probably typical -- most females like me are actually androgen-sensitive.
We're making androgen, and we're responding to androgens.
The consequence is that somebody like me has actually had a brain exposed to more androgens than the woman born with testes who has androgen insensitivity syndrome.
So sex is really complicated; it's not just that intersex people are in the middle of all the sex spectrum -- in some ways, they can be all over the place.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old, who was born a boy, raised a boy, had a girlfriend, had sex with his girlfriend, had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside.
What he had was an extreme form of a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
He had XX chromosomes, and in the womb, his adrenal glands were in such high gear that it created, essentially, a masculine hormonal environment.
And as a consequence, his genitals were masculinzed, his brain was subject to the more typical masculine component of hormones.
And he was born looking like a boy -- nobody suspected anything.
And it was only when he had reached the age of 19 that he began to have enough medical problems actually from menstruating internally, that doctors figured out that, in fact, he was female internally.
Okay, so just one more quick example of a way you can have intersex.
Some people who have XX chromosomes develop what are called ovotestis, which is when you have ovarian tissue with testicular tissue wrapped around it.
And we're not exactly sure why that happens.
So sex can come in lots of different varieties.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- whether it's dwarfism, or it's conjoined twinning, or it's an intersex type -- are often normalized by surgeons is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health.
In many cases, people are actually perfectly healthy.
The reason they're often subject to various kinds of surgeries is because they threaten our social categories.
Or system has been based typically on the idea that a particular kind of anatomy comes with a particular identity.
So we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity; what it means to be a black person is, allegedly, is to have an African anatomy in terms of your history.
And so we have this terribly simplistic idea.
And when we're faced with a body that actually presents us something quite different, it startles us in terms of those categorizations.
So we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individualism.
And our nation's really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism.
Well you can imagine how startling then it is when you have children that are born who are two people inside of one body.
Where I ran into the most heat from this most recently was last year the South African runner, Caster Semenya, had her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin.
I had a lot of journalists calling me, asking me, "Which is the test they're going to run that will tell us whether or not Caster Semenya is male or female?" .
And I had to explain to the journalists there isn't such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to admit nature doesn't draw the line for us between male and female, or between male and intersex and female and intersex; we actually draw that line on nature.
And it's not just in terms of sex.
It's also in terms of race, which turns out to be vastly more complicated than our terminology has allowed.
As we look, we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas.
We look, for example, about the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our DNA with chimpanzees.
What are we to make of the fact that we differ from them only really by a few nucleotides? .
And as we get farther and farther with our science, we get more and more into a discomforted zone where we have to acknowledge that the simplistic categories we've had are probably overly simplistic.
So we're seeing this in all sorts of places in human life.
One of the places we're seeing it, for example, in our culture today, in the United States today, is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life.
We have difficult conversations about at what point we decide a body becomes a human, such that it has a different right than a fetal life.
We have very difficult conversations nowadays -- probably not out in the open as much as within medicine -- about the question of when somebody's dead.
In the past, our ancestors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead.
At most, they'd stick a feather on somebody's nose, and if it twitched, they didn't bury them yet.
If it stopped twitching, you bury them.
But today, we have a situation where we want to take vital organs out of beings and give them to other beings.
And as a consequence, we're stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question about who's dead, and this leads us to a really difficult situation where we don't have such simple categories as we've had before.
Now you might think that all this breaking-down of categories would make somebody like me really happy.
I'm a political progressive, I defend people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit to you that it makes me nervous.
Understanding that these categories are really much more unstable than we thought makes me tense.
And it makes me tense from the point of view of thinking about democracy.
So in order to tell you about that tension, I have to first admit to you that I'm a huge fan of the Founding Fathers.
I know they were racists, I know they were sexist, but they were great.
I mean, they were so brave and so bold and so radical in what they did that I find myself watching that cheesy musical "1776" every few years, and it's not because of the music, which is totally forgettable.
It's because of what happened in 1776 with the Founding Fathers.
The Founding Fathers were, for my point of view, the original anatomical activists, and this is why.
What they rejected was an anatomical concept and replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years.
So as you all recall, what our Founding Fathers were rejecting was a concept of monarchy, and the monarchy was basically based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't have a concept of DNA, but they did have a concept of birthright.
They had a concept of blue blood.
They had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grandfather to father to son and so forth.
The Founding Fathers rejected that idea, and they replaced it with a new anatomical concept, and that concept was all men are created equal.
They leveled that playing field and decided the anatomy that mattered was the commonality of anatomy, not the difference in anatomy, and that was a really radical thing to do.
Now they were doing it in part because they were part of an Enlightenment system where two things were growing up together.
And that was democracy growing up, but it was also science growing up at the same time.
And it's really clear, if you look at the history of the Founding Fathers, a lot of them were very interested in science, and they were interested in a concept of a naturalistic world.
They were moving away from supernatural explanations, and they were rejecting things like a supernatural concept of power, where it transmitted because of a very vague concept of birthright.
They were moving towards a naturalistic concept.
And if you look, for example, in the Declaration of Independence, they talk about nature and nature's God.
They don't talk about God and God's nature.
They're talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
So as part of that, they were coming to us with a concept that was about anatomical commonality.
And in doing so, they were really setting up in a beautiful way the Civil Rights movement of the future.
They didn't think of it that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
So what happened years afterward? .
And women successfully argued that.
Next came the successful Civil Rights movement, where we found people like Sojourner Truth talking about, "Ain't I a woman?" .
We find men on the marching lines of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I am a man.
Again, people of color appealing to a commonality of anatomy over a difference of anatomy, again, successfully.
We see the same thing with the disability rights movement.
The problem is, of course, that, as we begin to look at all that commonality, we have to begin to question why we maintain certain divisions.
Now mind you, I want to maintain some divisions, anatomically, in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say we give up entirely on anatomy.
I don't want to say five-year-olds should be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry.
So there are some anatomical divisions that make sense to me and that I think we should retain.
But the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are and why do we retain them and do they have meaning.
So let's go back to those two beings conceived at the beginning of this talk.
We have two beings, both conceived in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day.
Let's imagine one of them, Mary, is born three months prematurely, so she's born on June 1, 1980.
Henry, by contrast, is born at term, so he's born on March 1, 1980.
Simply by virtue of the fact that Mary was born prematurely three months, she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than Henry does -- the right to consent to sex, the right to vote, the right to drink.
Henry has to wait for all of that, not because he's actually any different in age, biologically, except in terms of when he was born.
We find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are.
Henry, by virtue of being assumed to be male -- although I haven't told you that he's the XY one -- by virtue of being assumed to be male is now liable to be drafted, which Mary does not need to worry about.
Mary, meanwhile, cannot in all the states have the same right that Henry has in all the states, namely, the right to marry.
Henry can marry in every state a woman, but Mary can only marry today in a few states a woman.
So we have these anatomical categories that persist that are in many ways problematic and questionable.
And the question to me becomes: What do we do, as our science gets to be so good in looking at anatomy, that we reach the point where we have to admit that a democracy that's been based on anatomy might start falling apart? .
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us.
So where do we go? .
It seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pragmatic attitude: "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we will draw the line somewhere.
But a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position.
So for example, Texas has at one point decided that what it means to marry a man is to mean that you don't have a Y chromosome, and what it means to marry a woman means you do have a Y chromosome.
Now in practice they don't actually test people for their chromosomes.
But this is also very bizarre, because of the story I told you at the beginning about androgen insensitivity syndrome.
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr.
He says we should judge people "based not on the color of their skin, but on the content of their character," moving beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, that sounds like a really good idea.
But in practice, how do you do it? .
How do you judge people based on the content of character? .
I also want to point out that I'm not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans, because, I have to admit, that there are some golden retrievers I know that are probably more deserving of social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say there are probably also some yellow Labradors that I know that are more capable of informed, intelligent, mature decisions about sexual relations than some 40-year-olds that I know.
So how do we operationalize the question of content of character? .
It turns out to be really difficult.
And part of me also wonders, what if content of character turns out to be something that's scannable in the future -- able to be seen with an fMRI? .
Do we really want to go there? .
I'm not sure where we go.
What I do know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea of the United States being in the lead of thinking about this issue of democracy.
We've done a really good job struggling with democracy, and I think we would do a good job in the future.
We don't have a situation that Iran has, for example, where a man who's sexually attracted to other men is liable to be murdered, unless he's willing to submit to a sex change, in which case he's allowed to live.
We don't have that kind of situation.
I'm glad to say we don't have the kind of situation with -- a surgeon I talked to a few years ago who had brought over a set of conjoined twins in order to separate them, partly to make a name for himself.
But when I was on the phone with him, asking why he was going to do this surgery -- this was a very high-risk surgery -- his answer was that, in this other nation, these children were going to be treated very badly, and so he had to do this.
My response to him was, "Well, have you considered political asylum instead of a separation surgery?" .
The United States has offered tremendous possibility for allowing people to be the way they are, without having them have to be changed for the sake of the state.
So I think we have to be in the lead.
Well, just to close, I want to suggest to you that I've been talking a lot about the fathers.
And I want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like, or might have looked like, if we had more involved the mothers.
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and that is that I think that there may be different kinds of insights that can come from different kinds of anatomies, particularly when we have people thinking in groups.
Now for years, because I've been interested in intersex, I've also been interested in sex difference research.
And one of the things that I've been really interested in is looking at the differences between males and females in terms of the way they think and operate in the world.
And what we know from cross-cultural studies is that females, on average -- not everyone, but on average -- are more inclined to be very attentive to complex social relations and to taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group.
And so if we think about that, we have an interesting situation on our hands.
Years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my graduate advisers who knew I was interested in feminism -- I considered myself a feminist, as I still do -- asked a really strange question.
He said, "Tell me what's feminine about feminism.
And I thought, "Well that's the dumbest question I've ever heard.
Feminism is all about undoing stereotypes about gender, so there's nothing feminine about feminism.
But the more I thought about his question, the more I thought there might be something feminine about feminism.
That is to say, there might be something, on average, different about female brains from male brains that makes us more attentive to deeply complex social relationships and more attentive to taking care of the vulnerable.
So whereas the fathers were extremely attentive to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state, it's possible that if we injected more mothers into this concept, what we would have is more of a concept of, not just how to protect, but how to care for each other.
And maybe that's where we need to go in the future, when we take democracy beyond anatomy, is to think less about the individual body, in terms of the identity, and think more about those relationships.
So that as we the people try to create a more perfect union, we're thinking about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
I'm Jessi, and this is my suitcase.
But before I show you what I've got inside, I'm going to make a very public confession, and that is, I'm outfit-obsessed.
I love finding, wearing, and more recently, photographing and blogging a different, colorful, crazy outfit for every single occasion.
But I don't buy anything new.
I get all my clothes secondhand from flea markets and thrift stores.
Aww, thank you.
Secondhand shopping allows me to reduce the impact my wardrobe has on the environment and on my wallet.
I get to meet all kinds of great people; my dollars usually go to a good cause; I look pretty unique; and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt.
I mean, what am I going to find today? .
Is it going to be my size? .
Will I like the color? .
Will it be under $20? .
If all the answers are yes, I feel as though I've won.
I want to get back to my suitcase and tell you what I packed for this exciting week here at TED.
I mean, what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her? .
So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought.
I brought seven pairs of underpants and that's it.
Exactly one week's worth of undies is all I put in my suitcase.
I was betting that I'd be able to find everything else I could possible want to wear once I got here to Palm Springs.
And since you don't know me as the woman walking around TED in her underwear -- that means I found a few things.
And I'd really love to show you my week's worth of outfits right now.
Does that sound good? .
So as I do this, I'm also going to tell you a few of the life lessons that, believe it or not, I have picked up in these adventures wearing nothing new.
So let's start with Sunday.
I call this "Shiny Tiger.
You do not have to spend a lot of money to look great.
You can almost always look phenomenal for under $50.
This whole outfit, including the jacket, cost me $55, and it was the most expensive thing that I wore the entire week.
Monday: Color is powerful.
It is almost physiologically impossible to be in a bad mood when you're wearing bright red pants.
If you are happy, you are going to attract other happy people to you.
Tuesday: Fitting in is way overrated.
I've spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in.
Just be who you are.
If you are surrounding yourself with the right people, they will not only get it, they will appreciate it.
Wednesday: Embrace your inner child.
Sometimes people tell me that I look like I'm playing dress-up, or that I remind them of their seven-year-old.
I like to smile and say, "Thank you.
Thursday: Confidence is key.
If you think you look good in something, you almost certainly do.
And if you don't think you look good in something, you're also probably right.
I grew up with a mom who taught me this day-in and day-out.
But it wasn't until I turned 30 that I really got what this meant.
And I'm going to break it down for you for just a second.
If you believe you're a beautiful person inside and out, there is no look that you can't pull off.
So there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience.
We should be able to rock anything we want to rock.
Thank you.
Friday: A universal truth -- five words for you: Gold sequins go with everything.
And finally, Saturday: Developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
It's been proven to me time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what I'm wearing, and we've had great conversations.
So obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny suitcase.
So before I go home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything back.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn myself this week is that it's okay to let go.
I don't need to get emotionally attached to these things because around the corner, there is always going to be another crazy, colorful, shiny outfit just waiting for me, if I put a little love in my heart and look.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, everybody.
I've got something to show you.
Think about this as a pixel, a flying pixel.
This is what we call, in our lab, sensible design.
Let me tell you a bit about it.
Now if you take this picture -- I'm Italian originally, and every boy in Italy grows up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom -- but the reason I'm showing you this is that something very interesting happened in Formula 1 racing over the past couple of decades.
Now some time ago, if you wanted to win a Formula 1 race, you take a budget, and you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car.
And if the car and the driver were good enough, then you'd win the race.
This is what, in engineering terms, you would call a real time control system.
And basically, it's a system made of two components -- a sensing and an actuating component.
What is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to enter into our lives.
Our cities, over the past few years, just have been blanketed with networks, electronics.
They're becoming like computers in open air.
And, as computers in open air, they're starting to respond in a different way to be able to be sensed and to be actuated.
If we fix cities, actually it's a big deal.
Just as an aside, I wanted to mention, cities are only two percent of the Earth's crust, but they are 50 percent of the world's population.
They are 75 percent of the energy consumption -- up to 80 percent of CO2 emissions.
So if we're able to do something with cities, that's a big deal.
Beyond cities, all of this sensing and actuating is entering our everyday objects.
That's from an exhibition that Paola Antonelli is organizing at MoMA later this year, during the summer.
It's called "Talk to Me.
Well our objects, our environment is starting to talk back to us.
In a certain sense, it's almost as if every atom out there were becoming both a sensor and an actuator.
And that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there.
In a certain sense, it's almost as if the old dream of Michelangelo .
you know, when Michelangelo sculpted the Moses, at the end it said that he took the hammer, threw it at the Moses -- actually you can still see a small chip underneath -- and said, shouted, "Perche non parli? Why don't you talk?" .
Well today, for the first time, our environment is starting to talk back to us.
And I'll show just a few examples -- again, with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it.
Let's starting with sensing.
Well, the first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects by our lab.
It was four and a half years ago in Italy.
The summer was a lucky summer -- 2006.
It's when Italy won the soccer World Cup.
Some of you might remember, it was Italy and France playing, and then Zidane at the end, the headbutt.
And anyway, Italy won at the end.
Now look at what happened that day just by monitoring activity happening on the network.
Here you see the city.
You see the Colosseum in the middle, the river Tiber.
It's morning, before the match.
You see the timeline on the top.
Early afternoon, people here and there, making calls and moving.
The match begins -- silence.
France scores.
Halftime, people make a quick call and go to the bathroom.
Second half.
First overtime, second.
Zidane, the headbutt in a moment.
Italy wins.
Well, that night, everybody went to celebrate in the center.
You saw the big peak.
The following day, again everybody went to the center to meet the winning team and the prime minister at the time.
And then everybody moved down.
You see the image of the place called Circo Massimo, where, since Roman times, people go to celebrate, to have a big party, and you see the peak at the end of the day.
Well, that's just one example of how we can sense the city today in a way that we couldn't have done just a few years ago.
Another quick example about sensing: it's not about people, but about things we use and consume.
Well today, we know everything about where our objects come from.
This is a map that shows you all the chips that form a Mac computer, how they came together.
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project, we actually developed some small tags to track trash as it moves through the system.
So we actually started with a number of volunteers who helped us in Seattle, just over a year ago, to tag what they were throwing away -- different types of things, as you can see here -- things they would throw away anyway.
Then we put a little chip, little tag, onto the trash and then started following it.
Here are the results we just obtained.
From Seattle .
after one week.
With this information we realized there's a lot of inefficiencies in the system.
We can actually do the same thing with much less energy.
This data was not available before.
But there's a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening.
But the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup we're throwing away, it doesn't disappear, it's still somewhere on the planet.
And the plastic bottle we're throwing away every day still stays there.
And if we show that to people, then we can also promote some behavioral change.
So that was the reason for the project.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in Zaragoza, Spain.
It started with a question by the mayor of the city, who came to us saying that Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space, in architecture.
And the question was: How could technology, new technology, be added to that? .
And one of the ideas that was developed at MIT in a workshop was, imagine this pipe, and you've got valves, solenoid valves, taps, opening and closing.
You create like a water curtain with pixels made of water.
If those pixels fall, you can write on it, you can show patterns, images, text.
And even you can approach it, and it will open up to let you jump through, as you see in this image.
Well, we presented this to Mayor Belloch.
He liked it very much.
And we got a commission to design a building at the entrance of the expo.
We called it Digital Water Pavilion.
The whole building is made of water.
There's no doors or windows, but when you approach it, it will open up to let you in.
The roof also is covered with water.
And if there's a bit of wind, if you want to minimize splashing, you can actually lower the roof.
Or you could close the building, and the whole architecture will disappear, You know, these days, you always get images during the winter, when they take the roof down, of people who have been there and said, "They demolished the building.
No, they didn't demolish it, just when it goes down, the architecture almost disappears.
Here's the building working.
You see the person puzzled about what was going on inside.
And here was myself trying not to get wet, testing the sensors that open the water.
Well, I should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sensors stopped working.
But actually that night, it was even more fun.
All the kids from Zaragoza came to the building, because the way of engaging with the building became something different.
Not anymore a building that would open up to let you in, but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water, and you had to jump without getting wet.
And that was, for us, was very interesting, because, as architects, as engineers, as designers, we always think about how people will use the things we design.
But then reality's always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that are used and interact with people.
Here is an image then of the building with the physical pixels, the pixels made of water, and then projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the following project I'll show you now.
That's, imagine those pixels could actually start flying.
Imagine you could have small helicopters that move in the air, and then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights -- almost as a cloud that can move in space.
Here is the video.
So imagine one helicopter, like the one we saw before, moving with others, in synchrony.
So you can have this cloud.
You can have a kind of flexible screen or display, like this -- a regular configuration in two dimensions.
Or in regular, but in three dimensions, where the thing that changes is the light, not the pixels' position.
You can play with a different type.
Imagine your screen could just appear in different scales or sizes, different types of resolution.
But then the whole thing can be just a 3D cloud of pixels that you can approach and move through it and see from many, many directions.
Here is the real Flyfire control and going down to form the regular grid as before.
When you turn on the light, actually you see this.
And imagine each of them then controlled by people.
You can have each pixel having an input that comes from people, from people's movement, or so and so.
I want to show you something here for the first time.
We've been working with Roberto Bolle, one of today's top ballet dancers -- the etoile at Metropolitan in New York and La Scala in Milan -- and actually captured his movement in 3D in order to use it as an input for Flyfire.
And here you can see Roberto dancing.
You see on the left the pixels, the different resolutions being captured.
It's both 3D scanning in real time and motion capture.
So you can reconstruct a whole movement.
You can go all the way through.
But then, once we have the pixels, then you can play with them and play with color and movement and gravity and rotation.
So we want to use this as one of the possible inputs for Flyfire.
I wanted to show you the last project we are working on.
It's something we're working on for the London Olympics.
It's called The Cloud.
And the idea here is, imagine, again, we can involve people in doing something and changing our environment -- almost to impart what we call cloud raising -- like barn raising, but with a cloud.
Imagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one pixel.
And I think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that, over the past couple of decades, we went from the physical world to the digital one.
This has been digitizing everything, knowledge, and making that accessible through the Internet.
Now today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign showed us this -- we can go from the digital world, from the self-organizing power of networks, to the physical one.
This can be, in our case, we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol.
That means something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be, in order to tackle today's pressing challenges -- think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how we can go from the digital world to the physical one.
So the idea that we can actually involve people in doing this thing together, collectively.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels, in the same way as the real cloud is a cloud made of particles.
And those particles are water, where our cloud is a cloud of pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with pixels.
You can move inside, have different types of experiences.
You can actually see from underneath, sharing the main moments for the Olympics in 2012 and beyond, and really using it as a way to connect with the community.
So both the physical cloud in the sky and something you can go to the top [of], like London's new mountaintop.
You can enter inside it.
And a kind of new digital beacon for the night -- but most importantly, a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top.
Thank you.
As an artist, connection is very important to me.
Through my work I'm trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, where I saw my first icebergs.
I was in awe.
My heart beat fast, my head was dizzy, trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me.
The icebergs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water, and I could only help but wonder that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake, year after year.
Icebergs are born when they calve off of glaciers or break off of ice shelves.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end, while others can't take it anymore and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion.
It's easy to think, when you look at an iceberg, that they're isolated, that they're separate and alone, much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves.
But the reality is far from it.
As an iceberg melts, I am breathing in its ancient atmosphere.
As the iceberg melts, it is releasing mineral-rich fresh water that nourishes many forms of life.
I approach photographing these icebergs as if I'm making portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again.
It is not a death when they melt; it is not an end, but a continuation of their path through the cycle of life.
Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young -- a couple thousand years old.
And some of the ice is over 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are of an iceberg that I photographed in Qeqetarsuaq, Greenland.
It's a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling.
So here it is.
You can see on the left side a small boat.
That's about a 15-foot boat.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the waterline.
You can see here, it begins to roll, and the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is an average-size Greenlandic iceberg.
It's about 120 feet above the water, or 40 meters.
And this video is real time.
And just like that, the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality.
Thank you.
I have had the distinct blessing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects.
But the coolest I ever worked on was around this guy.
This guy's name is TEMPT.
TEMPT was one of the foremost graffiti artists in the 80s.
And he came up home from a run one day and said, "Dad, my legs are tingling.
And that was the onset of ALS.
So TEMPT is now completely paralyzed.
He only has use of his eyes.
I was exposed to him.
I have a company that does design and animation, so obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part of what we admire and respect in the art world.
And so we decided that we were going to sponsor Tony, TEMPT, and his cause.
So I went and met with his brother and father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with it?" .
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him And I said, "Wait a second, isn't that -- I've seen Stephen Hawking -- don't all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate via these devices?" .
And he said, "No, unless you're in the upper echelon and you've got really amazing insurance, you can't actually do that.
These devices aren't accessible to people.
And I said, "Well, how do you actually communicate?" .
Has everyone seen the movie "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly?" .
That's how they communicate -- so run their finger along.
I said, "That's archaic.
So I showed up with the desire to just write a check, and instead, I wrote a check that I had no freaking idea how I was going to cash.
I committed to his brother and his father right then and there -- I'm like, "All right, here's the deal: Tony's going to speak, we're going to get him a machine, and we're going to figure out a way for him to do his art again.
Because it's a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him isn't able to communicate it.
So I spoke at a conference a couple months after that.
I met these guys called GRL, Graffiti Research Lab, and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then, with a laser pointer, draw on it, and it just registers the negative space.
So they go around and do art installations like this.
All the things that go up there, they said there's a life cycle.
First it starts with the sexual organs, then it starts with cuss words, then it was Bush slanders and then people actually got to art.
But there was always a life cycle to their presentations.
So that started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a bunch of organization and a bunch of moving things around, we'd accomplished a couple things.
One, we battered down the doors of the insurance companies, and we actually got TEMPT a machine that let him communicate -- a Stephen Hawking machine.
Which was awesome.
And he's seriously one of the funniest -- I call him Yoda, because you talk to the guy, you get an email from him, and you're like, "I'm not worthy.
The other thing we did is we flew seven programmers from all over the world -- literally every corner of the world -- into our house.
My wife and kids and I moved to our back garage, and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house.
A lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the wall would be removed and graf on the walls.
But for over two weeks, we programmed, we went to the Venice boardwalk, my kids got involved, my dog got involved, and we created this.
This is called the EyeWriter, and you can see the description.
This is a cheap pair of sunglasses that we bought at the Venice Beach boardwalk, some copper wire and some stuff from Home Depot and Radio Shack.
We took a PS3 camera, hacked it open, mounted it to an LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- you build this yourself, we publish the code for free, you download the software for free.
And now we've created a device that has absolutely no limitations.
There's no insurance company that can say "No.
There's no hospital that can say "No.
Anybody who's paralyzed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you guys very much.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to TEMPT's room.
I love this picture, because this is someone else's room and that's his room.
So there's all this hustle and bustle going on for the big unveiling.
And after over a year of planning, two weeks of programming, carb-fest and all-night sessions, Tony drew again for the first time in seven years.
And this is an amazing picture, because this is his life support system, and he's looking over his life support system.
We kicked his bed so that he could see out.
And we set up a projector on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital.
And he drew again for the first time, in front of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what the feeling in the parking lot was.
The funny thing was, we had to break into the parking lot too, so we totally felt like we were legit in the whole graf scene too.
So at the end of this, he sent us an email, and this is what the email said: "That was the first time I've drawn anything for seven years.
I feel like I had been held underwater, and someone finally reached down and pulled my head up so I could breathe.
Isn't that awesome? .
So that's kind of our battle cry.
That's what keeps us going and keeps us developing.
And we've got such a long way to go with this.
This is an amazing device, but it's the equivalent of an Etch A Sketch.
And someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more.
So we're in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better, faster, stronger.
Since that time, we've had all kinds of acknowledgment.
We've won a bunch of awards.
Remember, it's free; none of us are making any money on this thing.
It's all coming out of our own pockets.
So the awards were like, "Oh, this is fantastic.
Armstrong Twittered about us, and then in December, Time magazine honored us as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, which was really cool.
The coolest thing about this -- and this is what's completing the whole circle -- is that in April of this year, at the Geffen MOCA in downtown Los Angeles, there's going to be an exhibition called "Art of the Streets.
And "Art of the Streets" is going to have pretty much the bad-asses of the street art scene -- Banksy, Shepard Fairey, KAWS -- all of these guys will be there.
TEMPT's going to be in the show, which is pretty awesome.
So basically this is my point: If you see something that's not possible, make it possible.
Everything in this room wasn't possible -- this stage, this computer, this mic, the EyeWriter -- wasn't possible at one point.
Make it possible, everyone in this room.
I'm not a programmer, never done anything with ocular recognition technology, but I just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen.
And this is the question I want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done: if not now, then when? And if not me, then who? .
Thank you guys.
You know, what I do is write for children, and I'm probably America's most widely read children's author, in fact.
And I always tell people that I don't want to show up looking like a scientist.
You can have me as a farmer, or in leathers, and no one has ever chose farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and epiphanies.
And you know, an epiphany is usually something you find that you dropped someplace.
You've just got to go around the block to see it as an epiphany.
That's a painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard Bollingbroke.
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to tell you about.
My circle began back in the '60s in high school in Stow, Ohio where I was the class queer.
I was the guy beaten up bloody every week in the boys' room, until one teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom in the teachers' lounge.
She did it in secret.
She did it for three years.
And I had to get out of town.
I had a thumb, I had 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- met a lover -- and back in the '80s, found it necessary to begin work on AIDS organizations.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher, Mrs.
I'm disappointed that we never got to know each other as adults.
Could you please come to Ohio, and please bring that man that I know you have found by now.
And I should mention that I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to please be quick about this.
Well, the next day we were in Cleveland.
We took a look at her, we laughed, we cried, and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice.
We found her one, we got her there, and we took care of her and watched over her family, because it was necessary.
It's something we knew how to do.
And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me, she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands.
And what had happened was the circle had closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany I talked about presented itself.
The epiphany is that death is a part of life.
She saved my life; I and my partner saved hers.
And you know, that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm so happy it's been mentioned so much here today.
It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure, and it's our job to hand those things out.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion as you climb through 3,000 ft.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine going clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack.
It sounds scary.
Well I had a unique seat that day.
I was the only one who could talk to the flight attendants.
So I looked at them right away, and they said, "No problem.
The pilot had already turned the plane around, and we weren't that far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot lines up the plane with the Hudson River.
That's usually not the route.
He turns off the engines.
Now imagine being in a plane with no sound.
And then he says three words -- the most unemotional three words I've ever heard.
He says, "Brace for impact.
I didn't have to talk to the flight attendant anymore.
I could see in her eyes, it was terror.
Now I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that it all changes in an instant.
We have this bucket list, we have these things we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to reach out to that I didn't, all the fences I wanted to mend, all the experiences I wanted to have and I never did.
As I thought about that later on, I came up with a saying, which is, "I collect bad wines.
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm opening it.
I no longer want to postpone anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as we clear the George Washington Bridge, which was by not a lot -- I thought about, wow, I really feel one real regret.
I've lived a good life.
In my own humanity and mistakes, I've tried to get better at everything I tried.
But in my humanity, I also allow my ego to get in.
And I regretted the time I wasted on things that did not matter with people that matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And after, as I reflected on that, I decided to eliminate negative energy from my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
I've not had a fight with my wife in two years.
It feels great.
I no longer try to be right; I choose to be happy.
The third thing I learned -- and this is as your mental clock starts going, "15, 14, 13.
You can see the water coming.
I'm saying, "Please blow up.
I don't want this thing to break in 20 pieces like you've seen in those documentaries.
And as we're coming down, I had a sense of, wow, dying is not scary.
It's almost like we've been preparing for it our whole lives.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to go; I love my life.
And that sadness really framed in one thought, which is, I only wish for one thing.
I only wish I could see my kids grow up.
About a month later, I was at a performance by my daughter -- first-grader, not much artistic talent .
.
And I'm bawling, I'm crying, like a little kid.
And it made all the sense in the world to me.
I realized at that point, by connecting those two dots, that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad.
Above all, above all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good dad.
I was given the gift of a miracle, of not dying that day.
I was given another gift, which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently.
I challenge you guys that are flying today, imagine the same thing happens on your plane -- and please don't -- but imagine, and how would you change? .
What would you get done that you're waiting to get done because you think you'll be here forever? .
How would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them? .
And more than anything, are you being the best parent you can? .
Thank you.
The idea behind the Stuxnet computer worm is actually quite simple.
We don't want Iran to get the bomb.
Their major asset for developing nuclear weapons is the Natanz uranium enrichment facility.
The gray boxes that you see, these are real-time control systems.
Now if we manage to compromise these systems that control drive speeds and valves, we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge.
The gray boxes don't run Windows software; they are a completely different technology.
But if we manage to place a good Windows virus on a notebook that is used by a maintenance engineer to configure this gray box, then we are in business.
And this is the plot behind Stuxnet.
So we start with a Windows dropper.
The payload goes onto the gray box, damages the centrifuge, and the Iranian nuclear program is delayed -- mission accomplished.
That's easy, huh? .
I want to tell you how we found that out.
When we started our research on Stuxnet six months ago, it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was.
The only thing that was known is it's very, very complex on the Windows part, the dropper part, used multiple zero-day vulnerabilities.
And it seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes, these real-time control systems.
So that got our attention, and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with Stuxnet and checked this thing out.
And then some very funny things happened.
Stuxnet behaved like a lab rat that didn't like our cheese -- sniffed, but didn't want to eat.
Didn't make sense to me.
And after we experimented with different flavors of cheese, I realized, well, this is a directed attack.
It's completely directed.
The dropper is prowling actively on the gray box if a specific configuration is found, and even if the actual program code that it's trying to infect is actually running on that target.
And if not, Stuxnet does nothing.
So that really got my attention, and we started to work on this nearly around the clock, because I thought, "Well, we don't know what the target is.
It could be, let's say for example, a U.
So we better find out what the target is soon.
So we extracted and decompiled the attack code, and we discovered that it's structured in two digital bombs -- a smaller one and a bigger one.
And we also saw that they are very professionally engineered by people who obviously had all insider information.
They knew all the bits and bites that they had to attack.
They probably even know the shoe size of the operator.
So they know everything.
And if you have heard that the dropper of Stuxnet is complex and high-tech, let me tell you this: the payload is rocket science.
It's way above everything that we have ever seen before.
Here you see a sample of this actual attack code.
We are talking about -- around about 15,000 lines of code.
Looks pretty much like old-style assembly language.
And I want to tell you how we were able to make sense out of this code.
So what we were looking for is, first of all, system function calls, because we know what they do.
And then we were looking for timers and data structures and trying to relate them to the real world -- to potential real world targets.
So we do need target theories that we can prove or disprove.
In order to get target theories, we remember that it's definitely hardcore sabotage, it must be a high-value target and it is most likely located in Iran, because that's where most of the infections had been reported.
Now you don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the Bushehr nuclear power plant and to the Natanz fuel enrichment plant.
So I told my assistant, "Get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base.
And I phoned them up and picked their brain in an effort to match their expertise with what we found in code and data.
And that worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the small digital warhead with the rotor control.
The rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge, that black object that you see.
And if you manipulate the speed of this rotor, you are actually able to crack the rotor and eventually even have the centrifuge explode.
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and creepy -- obviously in an effort to drive maintenance engineers crazy, that they would not be able to figure this out quickly.
The big digital warhead -- we had a shot at this by looking very closely at data and data structures.
So for example, the number 164 really stands out in that code; you can't overlook it.
I started to research scientific literature on how these centrifuges are actually built in Natanz and found they are structured in what is called a cascade, and each cascade holds 164 centrifuges.
So that made sense, that was a match.
And it even got better.
These centrifuges in Iran are subdivided into 15, what is called, stages.
And guess what we found in the attack code? .
An almost identical structure.
So again, that was a real good match.
And this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at.
Now don't get me wrong here, it didn't go like this.
These results have been obtained over several weeks of really hard labor.
And we often went into just a dead end and had to recover.
Anyway, so we figured out that both digital warheads were actually aiming at one and the same target, but from different angles.
The small warhead is taking one cascade, and spinning up the rotors and slowing them down, and the big warhead is talking to six cascades and manipulating valves.
So in all, we are very confident that we have actually determined what the target is.
It is Natanz, and it is only Natanz.
So we don't have to worry that other targets might be hit by Stuxnet.
Here's some very cool stuff that we saw -- really knocked my socks off.
Down there is the gray box, and on the top you see the centrifuges.
Now what this thing does is it intercepts the input values from sensors -- so for example, from pressure sensors and vibration sensors -- and it provides legitimate program code, which is still running during the attack, with fake input data.
And as a matter of fact, this fake input data is actually prerecorded by Stuxnet.
So it's just like from the Hollywood movies where during the heist, the observation camera is fed with prerecorded video.
That's cool, huh? .
The idea here is obviously not only to fool the operators in the control room.
It actually is much more dangerous and aggressive.
The idea is to circumvent a digital safety system.
We need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act quick enough.
So for example, in a power plant, when your big steam turbine gets too over speed, you must open relief valves within a millisecond.
Obviously, this cannot be done by a human operator.
So this is where we need digital safety systems.
And when they are compromised, then real bad things can happen.
Your plant can blow up.
And neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it.
That's scary.
But it gets worse.
And this is very important, what I'm going to say.
Think about this: this attack is generic.
It doesn't have anything to do, in specifics, with centrifuges, with uranium enrichment.
So it would work as well, for example, in a power plant or in an automobile factory.
It is generic.
And you don't have -- as an attacker -- you don't have to deliver this payload by a USB stick, as we saw it in the case of Stuxnet.
You could also use conventional worm technology for spreading.
Just spread it as wide as possible.
And if you do that, what you end up with is a cyber weapon of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we have to face.
So unfortunately, the biggest number of targets for such attacks are not in the Middle East.
They're in the United States and Europe and in Japan.
So all of the green areas, these are your target-rich environments.
We have to face the consequences, and we better start to prepare right now.
Thanks.
I've got a question.
Ralph, it's been quite widely reported that people assume that Mossad is the main entity behind this.
Is that your opinion? .
Okay, you really want to hear that? .
Yeah.
My opinion is that the Mossad is involved, but that the leading force is not Israel.
So the leading force behind that is the cyber superpower.
There is only one, and that's the United States -- fortunately, fortunately.
Because otherwise, our problems would even be bigger.
Thank you for scaring the living daylights out of us.
I have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somewhat dangerous.
I went to prison -- difficult.
I worked in a coal mine -- dangerous.
I filmed in war zones -- difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating nothing but this -- fun in the beginning, little difficult in the middle, very dangerous in the end.
So when I knew I was coming here to do a TED Talk that was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship, I knew I would want to do something a little different.
So as some of you may or may not have heard, a couple weeks ago, I took out an ad on eBay.
I sent out some Facebook messages, some Twitter messages, and I gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights to my 2011 TED Talk.
So what you were getting was this: Your name here presents: My TED Talk that you have no idea what the subject is and, depending on the content, could ultimately blow up in your face, especially if I make you or your company look stupid for doing it.
But that being said, it's a very good media opportunity.
You know how many people watch these TED Talks? .
It's a lot.
That's just a working title, by the way.
So even with that caveat, I knew that someone would buy the naming rights.
Now if you'd have asked me that a year ago, I wouldn't have been able to tell you that with any certainty.
But in the new project that I'm working on, my new film, we examine the world of marketing, advertising.
And as I said earlier, I put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years, but nothing could prepare me, nothing could ready me, for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
What I want to do is make a film all about product placement, marketing and advertising, where the entire film is funded by product placement, marketing and advertising.
So the movie will be called "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.
So what happens in "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold," is that everything from top to bottom, from start to finish, is branded from beginning to end -- from the above-the-title sponsor that you'll see in the movie, which is brand X.
Now this brand, the Qualcomm Stadium, the Staples Center .
these people will be married to the film in perpetuity -- forever.
And so the film explores this whole idea -- It's what? In perpetuity, forever? .
I'm a redundant person.
That was more for emphasis.
It was, "In perpetuity.
But not only are we going to have the brand X title sponsor, but we're going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film.
So maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore .
the greatest car you ever drove from "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold," the greatest drink you've ever had, courtesy of "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.
So the idea is, beyond just showing that brands are a part of your life, but actually get them to finance the film? .
And actually we show the whole process of how does it work.
The goal of this whole film is transparency.
You're going to see the whole thing take place in this movie.
So that's the whole concept, the whole film, start to finish.
And I would love for CEG to help make it happen.
You know it's funny, because when I first hear it, it is the ultimate respect for an audience.
I don't know how receptive people are going to be to it, though.
Do you have a perspective -- I don't want to use "angle" because that has a negative connotation -- but do you know how this is going to play out? .
How much money does it take to do this? .
1.
I think that you're going to have a hard time meeting with them, but I think it's certainly worth pursuing a couple big, really obvious brands.
Who knows, maybe by the time your film comes out, we look like a bunch of blithering idiots.
What do you think the response is going to be? .
The responses mostly will be "no.
But is it a tough sell because of the film or a tough sell because of me? .
JK: Both.
.
So, sir, can you help me? I need help.
I can help you.
Okay.
Awesome.
We've gotta figure out which brands.
Yeah.
When you look at the people you deal with .
We've got some places we can go.
Turn the camera off.
I thought "Turn the camera off" meant, "Let's have an off-the-record conversation.
Turns out it really means, "We want nothing to do with your movie.
And just like that, one by one, all of these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of them wanted anything to do with this movie.
I was amazed.
They wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project.
And I was blown away, because I thought the whole concept, the idea of advertising, was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible, to get as many people to see it as possible.
Especially in today's world, this intersection of new media and old media and the fractured media landscape, isn't the idea to get that new buzz-worthy delivery vehicle that's going to get that message to the masses? .
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had one fatal flaw, and that flaw was this.
Actually no, that was not the flaw whatsoever.
That wouldn't have been a problem at all.
This would have been fine.
But what this image represents was the problem.
See, when you do a Google image search for transparency, this is --- This is one of the first images that comes up.
So I like the way you roll, Sergey Brin.
This is was the problem: transparency -- free from pretense or deceit; easily detected or seen through; readily understood; characterized by visibility or accessibility of information, especially concerning business practices -- that last line being probably the biggest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency these days.
Our politicians say it, our president says it, even our CEO's say it.
But suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality, something suddenly changes.
But why? Well, transparency is scary -- like that odd, still-screaming bear.
It's unpredictable -- like this odd country road.
And it's also very risky.
What else is risky? .
Eating an entire bowl of Cool Whip.
That's very risky.
Now when I started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story, and they said, "No, we want you to tell a story.
We want you to tell a story, but we just want to tell our story.
See, when I was a kid and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie -- and there he is giving me the look he often gave me -- he would say, "Son, there's three sides to every story.
There's your story, there's my story and there's the real story.
Now you see, with this film, we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, one agency willing to help me -- and that's only because I knew John Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum for years -- I realized that I would have to go on my own, I'd have to cut out the middleman and go to the companies myself with all of my team.
So what you suddenly started to realize -- or what I started to realize -- is that when you started having conversations with these companies, the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
I have friends who make great big, giant Hollywood films, and I have friends who make little independent films like I make.
And the friends of mine who make big, giant Hollywood movies say the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners that they have.
And then my friends who make small independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant Hollywood movies?" .
And the movie is called "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.
So how specifically will we see Ban in the film? .
Any time I'm ready to go, any time I open up my medicine cabinet, you will see Ban deodorant.
While anytime I do an interview with someone, I can say, "Are you fresh enough for this interview? .
Are you ready? You look a little nervous.
I want to help you calm down.
So maybe you should put some one before the interview.
So we'll offer one of these fabulous scents.
Whether it's a "Floral Fusion" or a "Paradise Winds," they'll have their chance.
We will have them geared for both male or female -- solid, roll-on or stick, whatever it may be.
That's the two-cent tour.
So now I can answer any of your questions and give you the five-cent tour.
We are a smaller brand.
Much like you talked about being a smaller movie, we're very much a challenger brand.
So we don't have the budgets that other brands have.
So doing things like this -- you know, remind people about Ban -- is kind of why were interested in it.
What are the words that you would use to describe Ban? .
Ban is blank.
That's a great question.
Superior technology.
Technology's not the way you want to describe something somebody's putting in their armpit.
We talk about bold, fresh.
I think "fresh" is a great word that really spins this category into the positive, versus "fights odor and wetness.
It keeps you fresh.
How do we keep you fresher longer -- better freshness, more freshness, three times fresher.
Things like that that are more of that positive benefit.
And that's a multi-million dollar corporation.
What about me? What about a regular guy? .
I need to go talk to the man on the street, the people who are like me, the regular Joes.
They need to tell me about my brand.
How would you guys describe your brand? .
Um, my brand? .
I don't know.
I like really nice clothes.
80's revival meets skater-punk, unless it's laundry day.
All right, what is brand Gerry? .
Unique.
I guess what kind of genre, style I am would be like dark glamor.
I like a lot of black colors, a lot of grays and stuff like that.
But usually I have an accessory, like sunglasses, or I like crystal and things like that too.
If Dan were a brand, he might be a classic convertible Mercedes Benz.
The brand that I am is, I would call it casual fly.
Part hippie, part yogi, part Brooklyn girl -- I don't know.
I'm the pet guy.
I sell pet toys all over the country, all over the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my warped little industry, that's my brand.
My brand is FedEx because I deliver the goods.
Failed writer-alcoholic brand.
Is that something? .
I'm a lawyer brand.
I'm Tom.
Well we can't all be brand Tom, but I do often find myself at the intersection of dark glamor and casual fly.
And what I realized is I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could get inside my head, somebody who could really help me understand what they call your "brand personality.
And so I found a company called Olson Zaltman in Pittsburg.
They've helped companies like Nestle, Febreze, Hallmark discover that brand personality.
If they could do it for them, surely they could do it for me.
You brought your pictures, right? .
I did.
So tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are.
These are the people who shape the way I look at the world.
Tell me about this world.
This world? I think your world is the world that you live in -- like people who are around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the job you do.
All those things stemmed and started from one place, and for me they stemmed and started with my family in West Virginia.
What's the next one you want to talk about? .
The next one: This was the best day ever.
How does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are? .
It's like, who do I want to be? .
I like things that are different.
I like things that are weird.
Tell me about the "why" phase -- what does that do for us? .
What is the machete? What pupa stage are you in now? .
Why is it important to reboot? What does the red represent? .
Tell me a little bit about that part.
.
What are some other metamorphoses that you've had? .
.
EEEEEE! No, thank you.
Thanks for you patience.
Yeah.
Yeah, I don't know what's going to come of this.
There was a whole lot of crazy going on in there.
The first thing we saw was this idea that you had two distinct, but complementary sides to your brand personality -- the Morgan Spurlock brand is a mindful/play brand.
Those are juxtaposed very nicely together.
And I think there's almost a paradox with those.
And I think some companies will just focus on one of their strengths or the other instead of focusing on both.
What other brands are like that? .
The first on here is the classic, Apple.
And you can see here too, Target, Wii, Mini from the Mini Coopers, and JetBlue.
Now there's playful brands and mindful brands, those things that have come and gone, but a playful, mindful brand is a pretty powerful thing.
A playful, mindful brand.
If somebody asked you to describe your brand identity, your brand personality, what would you be? .
Are you an up attribute? Are you something that gets the blood flowing? .
Or are you more of a down attribute? .
Are you something that's a little more calm, reserved, conservative? .
Up attributes are things like being playful, being fresh like the Fresh Prince, contemporary, adventurous, edgy or daring like Errol Flynn, nimble or agile, profane, domineering, magical or mystical like Gandalf.
Or are you more of a down attribute? .
Are you mindful, sophisticated like 007? .
Are you established, traditional, nurturing, protective, empathetic like the Oprah? .
Are you reliable, stable, familiar, safe, secure, sacred, contemplative or wise like the Dalai Lama or Yoda? .
Over the course of this film, we had 500-plus companies who were up and down companies saying, "no," they didn't want any part of this project.
They wanted nothing to do with this film, mainly because they would have no control, they would have no control over the final product.
They enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing, as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they're using MRI's to target the desire centers of your brain for both commercials as well as movie marketing.
We went to San Paulo where they have banned outdoor advertising.
In the entire city for the past five years, there's no billboards, there's no posters, there's no fliers, nothing.
And we went to school districts where now companies are making their way into cash-strapped schools all across America.
What's incredible for me is the projects that I've gotten the most feedback out of, or I've had the most success in, are ones where I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands did.
They cut out the middleman, they cut out their agencies and said, "Maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that's going to get people thinking, that's going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has that been for them? Has it been successful? .
Well, since the film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, let's take a look.
According to Burrelles, the movie premiered in January, and since then -- and this isn't even the whole thing -- we've had 900 million media impressions for this film.
That's literally covering just like a two and a half-week period.
That's only online -- no print, no TV.
The film hasn't even been distributed yet.
It's not even online.
It's not even been out into other foreign countries yet.
So ultimately, this film has already started to gain a lot of momentum.
And not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to advised their clients not to take part.
What I always believe is that if you take chances, if you take risks, that in those risks will come opportunity.
