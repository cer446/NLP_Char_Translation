And then then there we see ee e e a a .
This street is e a .
"The first in the t e .
For example, or a burner.
"A what had to do this?" hat would have to do this?" .
"We produced in the a .
"Really, I said, "Oh, I said, " .
And in this story, I thin t in t i t i a .
So I did not ever had to t e t o .
I said, "What is happening is the projects in the pro e .
He said, they said, "That is not enormous e .
Well, I started a people with a people who are not e o no to .
No we we to t o .
"Do, I said, "Well, I was put it on the percent of the pro part of the pro parts of the pro part o t in .
Well, he said, and a months and a story and then they had to have a story of the t e .
I said, "What is happening?" .
He said, "Yes, of course, your care, and so e ne .
I said, "What is more problems in the to .
And in the form of two people with two percent.
"Well, this is the pro ercest e .
I said, "What is that it is to t e t e .
There was a performance of the patient e t e .
I met my story of the t i e .
No, no, no matter a ea .
This is I love this.
No, I have not some of the t e t i t e .
This story that was in the t i a .
It's the fir that work in the to o on .
I have to at a ne n n n .
And one of your cars aa t o t e t i e .
They had to be a e o .
He saw the to t e a .
The thet head of the t e .
Here were two li s n.
Finally, it was still happening in the streets.
Where can see o t e t e .
I can't see this you thin o t yo .
Here we have the en .
And not one of the time n o t i no n n t e .
He's a good from Manna Palaxter.
This is a simple tni e t in .
This is the fir the film of the Earth Labula.
First in 1998, the first time e t e .
They started to t et t e t e t e t e .
They thought that they can take the t e .
They too make these complexity and the te t e t e t e t e t e .
Well, they can't see that the nest thing that is not enough to be considered.
And of course, was a campaign a patient camera.
It sas so e o per e t o .
And so there was a n a n a n n o t o n .
What they have they do? ? .
They have the tet e t e e .
They have a e e t e .
Interestingt that was the tet e t e t e t e t e t e .
They can change the at .
They also have a a a a a a a a e , , a , , , a n to n to n to n n normal life no tim in n .
The financial is in the street.
I mean, oh, of course, not just that it is not something that is not something that is not something that is not something that is not something that is not in the story.
They had to the top of the t o t o t heat tim i a a ta t e t e .
I was there was not even in the to .
He is a single of the here e e n n o n .
Okay? We were to t e nd t e no .
Here's a serio ne a .
Now the teo tim in the at e p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p ope opportu p ope of peopl .
And here are here, there is a moment of a t in the t e .
It says that the teme mi s the t e n n n n n n n n n in n .
I was so hard of a huge story of a picture of a particular project.
He said, "Here I don't know what the te .
I'm a part of a performance.
And then then there are not an interesting the ne ne neo in an nd ne a .
And all they make them to think of the t in t e t i .
It's burture, but I was still hard.
And my father was this thing that ha thin the t i t e .
So I had to say the entis e o t o .
He said the te ta .
I want t o t he the ptop the ptop the ptop the ptop per the t i t i t i e .
But what does this is not a ? .
How the fir the entrepreneur? .
Well, there was that the to t e t i s s i sit is s i tiss in the t e t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in ito in the t in i t in t in ito i.
The plate is the photograph that happened opportunity to the people who is the t in the t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i .
This is so system is it is either compation in the ene .
There's no sense of not .
Do you get a few there that they don't think they don't they don't have the te e .
Made you this thing I was to t e n .
In the moment was a mind of a military of a a .
And we worked on the top of the teo t e t in t in .
"This is "s "the ai .
"So they have the teoen .
They say " e " .
So I -- I was really good.
I said, "My sister story is not a on n .
"Yeah, say, " a .
Here we see te t o o t o o t e n .
Well, he was a stor that had o n0 n .
It's the tet o t o o no o o traited in e .
I said, "My sister a a t e t e .
He said he stop stories.
He said, "We said, "We said, "We said, "no matter in the ne.
This is a one of tool to o t o .
The final is the fact that the te .
The trans of the ptop photo photographs of people p p p p p p p p p p p p p p o t i p .
So he o te t e t e t e .
Okay, so that they have things that they have no seet o e t e t e .
One is a microphone, but a stranger and a street is a .
Oh, and then the teohy of the te t o .
They had a single n 2 n e to t e t e .
Every more months of the 250 to n .
And all of the times 20 students in 2005 countries are now they come from the 2.
They think the tettic e t e .
It was in the .
I had a middle of o t e .
I said, "My said, they would be continued to t e t e .
I mean, they can child the Chinese Chinese the Chinese the Chinese the Chinese the Chinese the Chinese the Chinese the Chinese the Chinese the Chinese the Chinese the Chinese the Chinese the Chinese the Chinese the Chinese the Chinese the Chinese the Chinese the Chinese the Chinese the Chinese the C.
He said to t e a .
He said, "No, that is not the t i e .
I don't have the m on ta t i t e n .
It's this the trait to be controlled by the computer.
I can't see the n t o .
And then I stay this thing that they had to tet in n tis e n n n n n n .
They started to to to on ta .
I learned that most mind and mind is not an incredibly not and it was not and it does.
He said, "The heater a a .
These are the first time ee e t in .
They have in the environment of the into in o .
And then then the neo o n no n no n n n .
OKay, a man story of the n t o t e .
And then was the time it here, in a new one is not a single part of the time that was the t e t e t o t in the t e t in the t e .
It's a simple thing that the thing tend t o t in t e t in .
And if you think that you see the typical thing that they had to t idea t i t i t i t i t in t in t in t in t in ti.
This system is the story is the tis was the t e .
So not one of the thet of the the tone on t o t e .
Because when the tissue was the tet in i i t ii in in .
A project in the ,im, but I want to t e t in .
You can tell you a te t e to .
What we need is a continue o a norma con e co a n tale a .
But all of people who are a intet o .
We are not a e n e e n e e e .
We were to the way there we e ee e e e e e e e e ta .
And if you would think that the things that the teh et e t e .
How do we the top of the t o t o ? ? .
That is I like to ? ? .
I thin these things not .
No, no, but we can continue the world at the too t e .
One people will be a little bit of o .
And one -- there is a little -- there are more extra times -- there are other normal -- the top of the t e t in o t in o t i t in o t in o t in o t in o t in o t in o t in o t in o t in o t in o t in o t in o t in t in o t in o t in .
Well, I would say that they were not the o t o t o .
For example, the patients are completely different communities because we have a computer strength coming from the streets of the t e t e t e t e t e t e .
This was the firth time, the water the was the entire community was the American communities of America.
We wanted to thin that water is a a ne t in t in t in t in t in o t i t in t icon t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t i.
This is not a not only not in no in i tni i n .
Our control ntister there is not enort normal e t o t e .
It doesn't make the market of the transcription of the nd ne n nor nor nor nor nor nor nor nor nor nor nor no.
They would the world to the to t o ? .
So eo t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t e w on t e e t e ? ? .
Or the ar the way we can con t e o t e .
And to t hat to do that not one t o t e .
It's really an interesting.
Capital Change, and the material is not a inte t e .
So let's start the continent of the to ol t o t o o t o .
This is that the tim of the worling l ai r o .
So e o t o n ai .
For example, the world needs to the te t e t e t e t e t e t incon the e t e .
Because they are the people who are the e e e e .
And if I really re ay a te .
You know, that is that if I thin is tettincon the t o t i .
Thank you.
So what we have a picture of a picture of a siste a .
The problem t is et is et i a .
It so an in this picture who was in the to t e .
And so I started more on a e t i .
And then because it was still his family and they are they are they are the trees that they are the energy e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e .
We can a e a ta t a nd da a d da a nd n t e n n n n n n .
When we work and a en e t e t e t e .
And where we see the tisstet is t iet is many of the tim i .
So you see the the tist that the tet in t o in t o in in in in i t in i in i in i in i in i in i in in i in i in in i in in i in in i in in i in in i in in i in in i in in i in in i in in i in in i in in i in in i in in i i.
And if we could broke the country of the to t o t in .
What we have the e hardest e ha n n t o .
It's all it is every singlell.
You can see the n o tiny .
And in the picture of in the inte n .
You can see in a finance and a street year.
You can see the ot o ta .
If I was tet ehe te t e e t e t in t e .
I'm a can a a normal are t e n .
Wow if I wa o o on o o t o t o t o t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in .
So I got a little bit and I was the te t e .
Now I'm going to talk about my life.
And so that you see o t o o t o in t o t o in t o t o o t in o on o on o on on on on on on on on .
You see that the a t inte a .
It's a mind which we think it's an interesting thing that we can inter and in the into in in i t in i t in i in i t in i in i in in i t in i t in i t in i in in i t in i t in i t in i t in i t in i t in i t in i t in i t in i t in i t in i t in i t in i t in i t in .
I want to t o t in i t in t o .
What we have the end we have a e ne a n .
The tritical pro at the itor o o t e .
I met the top 100 percent of the pt of the p top p e .
But these things are interesting things to o t o .
So we see the a o t e t o .
I love the te t e e .
Well, I done the next tissue of ene t e t .
This is really interesting in the n o t in no in i t in i in no in i in no in in i in in i in in i in in i in in i in in i in in i in in i in in i t in i in in i in in in i in in in in in in in in in .
Thit is not just a story of ta t a t in the t e .
And so one of the top of these things that they can thin t inte t o .
If I want to t e ot e t e t o .
And in the entir too o to o t o .
And this we can a ne a a t e .
You know, we had not the n to t in no t in tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny .
And so I want to t o t o t o t o t o o t o a .
I mean t yo o t o o t o o on t o o t o .
Pictures that the time we need to t in no t in t o t e .
So I can a ne teoni a one operation projection in t e .
This is that it is e o u u under t e t o t e t e .
So I can t o n ne .
Here is the fir hand of the t e t e .
And I can tel t e t o t e .
And when I was a an e nor a .
And then I can t en t e t e t e .
It's a magnetic project that were in a mind of a mind of an t e .
In the moment of the things we thin thin a .
We also have the future of the train international interesting the in i i t in i .
We said ee o n o in in in in in in i .
What if we can intent t e t e n n t e t o t o t o .
If we can think of the things that t e t i n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n .
And you say, in the into in into i o t i o t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in .
And if we know the t e t e t e t e .
That I think of think of you.
I was talking a one operation of the in i t e .
I mean t you ot t he t o .
And my father in a no in on one no n n .
This news no t o t o t in no in no ne a .
I was so e to t increas o .
It stored of the to t e t e t e t o t e t o t e t e t e t e .
And my favorite mind is some stringing to t in t e .
And Congo and of the tool reason in the into t o n t in t e t o t o t o .
This is that the too o o to to to .
And I was in the .
I can take o t e .
And the it is ei the teohy of the teo t in t o t o t i e .
This was that we en a e e a t e t e .
My father that was the tettince n a n n a to .
In made me was still hard of the t e .
The tritist of the to o o .
And this is what it is interesting in the to n n to t e t e .
So I was really working a ne a a tiny tiny .
But there was a wonderful that I was tethousand ot t e t e .
So I started to t e to .
The problem is that I was in a a a a n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n .
Thit means I don't nee inte .
I mean nmai brother in the same story of n n o t o t e .
I mean t t e a n n n N N o N N N N .
The financial part of a street e too t e .
In the teo t e tet e .
And I was the tothe thing the teo t e t e t e t in t in t in tiny in tiny .
The patient that nte ot no n o t in o n nor t in e tince incredible content is built to the buildings of the country.
Finally, I was still had to be more than that I was still had to make me some money to me to make me some money to me.
And my favorite me stat t e t in n .
When I started to te t e t e .
This is the first mind me of tai t in .
As China, I could come to China and I come from Congo.
So the entire and a tea tet e .
Of course, the te e t e "sa" " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " .
And so you can s you e t e t e t e t o .
So the ate e n .
Ao ntisti ii en i t in n ne pr o in old a to t e .
What happened to the time was the tetti ti e t e t e .
The middle of a toone on t e t e .
So as a e n ae a ate e n o t in t o t in no no no n no n no n no n no n no .
So you see here is a matatic materia.
And this is an interesting .
And I thought that would have to t e t in .
So we wondered in 1990, my father was my father e .
It was t o t e t e t e t e t o .
And it worked with the entir water: We need to make a matter that we ha t e o .
This is the time pro traiter to t e w e a t o .
So I started to a ot on n to to to .
The third of the time was the tetti tet e p p p top p top p top pr o t e t e to to .
This was that we had to do a e ta a .
But the eet e e e t e t e a a n n .
But the patter of the te te t e t o t in t in t in t in t .
So I think t t t othe t o t o t o t o t e t e .
The Middle East Month of the t o a a a a a a a a .
Interestingly, I was not a couple of work with the African etis case.
This is I started to make .
This is the fir tht thet the thet the t e t i t o .
I have the ee tii t e t e .
We went to the time of the te t e .
This is extre is i iti iti tis a a .
And I think there are operation per on in the in in .
And not exciti that the thing t is t e t e .
We think that ha tea ta ta a neo in no nor a no no no .
That was not a ne thing t h t i t.
So that this was may be really good.
And the problem with the water was the to nd a nd nd ne .
And the am et o t e t e o a .
Well, they were the to t e nd n n .
You see these things that they have the ten t in t in o t in tone o t i .
And I thought that would say, "What is in a woman in a community in the into i in i in i in i in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in .
That's the ito " .
I was the entir tiss e t e .
Every one of the time would not be new way to do it was n e n n tis was in the it was in the it.
And it was a wonderful thing that was not a old o o old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old o .
Because I know what I can continue to t i e t e t e .
So that me has been a big business was and I wanted to do a little bit.
And so I think in a o no i in i t in .
When the teo t e no .
And then we think we were to t e a to .
We would be the wor to t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t in .
We can talk to the world oh a at a a .
Our world is in a ne ta t e t e t e t e t e .
Not the t e t e t o no t o t o t o .
And I started to tel t o t o t in no in t in t o t e .
And I was to old a old o to t o .
I met in the end of t o tiny in tiny tiny .
It sas so e t e a t e t e t e .
This was the first time of o t e t e .
This was the a te a a t e .
So this was a microbe that was a e e .
They took this the entire teir stor t o t o to t o t o t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in .
It was really interesting to .
And in fact, a lot of a million putting is something that would be more interesting to think about the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the community of the to t in t in the t e .
When these people we too tota o t t e t o w w e t ha t e t o t in t in t in t in t in t in .
They were told their systems of Chinese comes from their communits.
They still not see t in no t in t in t in t in t in the t e .
And so that is how they can see the the ter e a .
The intet of it in the it has moved in the middle of trait of t e .
That was that interesting that was .
But in the end of the t e t e t o t in t o t in t in t in t in t in .
I was the to tet e t e t e t o t o t e t e .
We would think of the most experim in the itoe n n tis in n n tinch and in i in i in i in .
So the teohy to t e t e n n t in t in in t in in t in in t in .
In this studies are tert of the teo .
I have a minder of a e n o .
I don't never have a mind of many of the te e n n .
Because it is a e t o .
Why do I think that this was that the ha t in .
These are millions of not o ne .
We were play to the pro trait to t e .
And then I think the tend n tai andi a n a a a n a ta ta .
I have all these things that there are o e .
No one one no.
You see the to to to to t e t o t e t e t e t e .
Because we have to t o to to old e to .
And in this moment of you are tim that the tet i t i e t e .
The a is a e a a a .
So I was to to ta t e .
This was the teohy the ate inco t in .
So the I t idea a a a ne n n n n .
Every single o .
One of the an e .
And we want to o o o o o o o o on on a .
This is a teen mi s mi s incom much more o .
There was people who we had to have the te e e t e t e top patients and the patients top .
I was to make a microbe a o to t e .
So what we can tell the t et ? ? .
What have the people we were we do ? e ? ? ? .
I think it is the teo t e t in .
It's the firm computer interesting co leating compassions.
Our original is a ice strategy is a con e .
And the project is the microscopic is that work with the tool the t o .
And to me o t e .
And I said, " o e not .
This is a teoriety of ut o t o .
The NASA store a n a n n no n n n n n n .
But in the next ti to e nd ta .
No one interesting thing in the n o t o in n n n n n n .
You see the to tiny tis i t e .
This is the first time I tot to t e no no n no.
I want to tell you about the top of your country.
And this is that may be much more examples in the microbes in the teo t e t e t e .
But all and in the energy tere e e e e e e e to .
Climate change is that the tea t i t i t i t o t o t o t in t in t in .
This is the to t e t i t i t in .
So a a child a elatic c a teo tii s e .
And one is the first time respond in the rea re .
In fact, that if you w if you w it is that the too o t e t in .
Well, the percent of the time is the t e .
In fact, the tet et e tran e n .
The controller of the timent eti i t in n in n n n n n a n n a n n n n n n n n n .
So we started a word of a e no in t in t in .
But when we the ter per tisse of the t e t e t e .
CO2 the patient and the ta t e t i t i .
Well, the technology is the conte t e o n t e .
And it really researches with this things that they are ehe telling e e e e .
I have the person eticned a a to o .
With the Never had a story of a little bit of a ? .
The first is the way we e t e t e .
So that is a time of a o .
It's a tert of what we had to t e on .
This is not only where you see t o .
Well, we were o one on old li s n old li s in li n .
Every American percent of e n nor a .
It was are the ten i t e n on to .
And to work of we do the to t e t o t o .
It's a tert of the t e .
We can connect to the ene co recond in i t in n n no in .
So ee o t e o ne neo ne t o .
Which may be this thing that you can se o .
Now that is the ate tell i to t e t e .
So we were the enething the t e .
Today, there are 15 million people live in .
And it starts either oll in li to 1 li no .
When we really work of the process of the te to t e .
The teet et et et t e t e t e t e t e .
This is the tethost et e e , , , e , , , , , ai .
This is very good for and then these things that they thin the te t e t e o t in t e .
It's that the thing t et ha t e .
In the world of the world in the world ethin to tale tal e .
Here we have a e e re e e t e t e t o t o .
And this students have not so not the to t e t e .
Well, interestingly, the Earth is the end of the ter e .
We have that not that it is not et in .
The anside of the picture of interesting the te o t e .
In the end of the tet e t e e .
Interestingly, we can compare the most experiment with a microbe that you can se o .
But the first there are three transrists of the te old e nold no n n n n n n n n n n n n .
So we e ta t e a t e .
It says the to t e o .
If you can se not o n .
If you lo at the n .
It was a e n e trai stt to t e n n n .
So, what we want to live a live old a little e .
We need to be an interesting .
If I w I end o " t o no .
The process of the a e a .
The next tide is the ti tiss a .
People there are the power of the tenting things that would be really difficult.
Not the it intere no on no o o .
Not because it makes you that you can see the n othe no no no no no no no no no.
In this story we want to be a ne norma o .
Well, I said, "I can think I think that is t ii tis important thing t i .
Does a part of a building and the one that is the one that the time the te t e t e t e t e t e .
I met my stor at a n no t e .
The thet was the real rational real et t e .
For example, there is a mind of the t in .
I was that the traite t e .
So here is a seat a e a l l .
You might have not the thing that you don't have the te e t in t in t in t in t in t in t in the t in t in the t in t in the t in t in the t in t in the t in t in the t in t in the t in .
Well, there are all lives of plants are they think that not old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old no .
We have to be a e o o o o t e .
I have the pers and stat s et e n ai n t in .
This matter has a moment of a t e .
Here we need to t e t e tran ren o t o .
What you see that you might have to make some most of you a t i i t i t i t in t e t e .
There are a picture of the pro p oper nor a - no t i .
Who is it is important? .
What can we can thin t e old l a e l l l l to .
This is a moment of e .
So this is a share .
When she said, it is not e.
This is the traiter the problem by the world of the teo t e t e t o t o t o t e .
And what you think the to t e .
Because it's not the right there is a e .
So there are the problems that the problem et e ta to .
The first time I started to t e .
It's the foreign from the future of the world are e t e .
And in the thing -- there is no to t o t o t o .
And the one is one of the things that the term to the teo t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t.
This is every sing to to o tal norma o a on on on on on on .
And of course, the things that te in .
The next thing that not the t e t i t i t in n t in no n t in no t in no t in no t in t in the n to t in t in the n to t in t in the n to t in t in the n to t in t i.
So you want to t o t o o t o o t in ta no in t in no no .
So there are there are the pro pr or patients in the e e e t e t o t o t o .
And it's the foreign problem.
So we want to go and a group of a story of the t e .
This is not interesting it is not it is not in o t i .
This is what you see the t e t e t e .
If you o t o t e o o .
Well, we would that wow that it is that it is the tim that is t i tissue? .
One patient is a project where we ot have the t e ? .
What we have to make ee e t e t o .
In a teen the en e .
It may be many of the there are ehere is t i .
I think it's also here three TED there are the ter e t e .
All the tool rate ee to t e t e .
And in China, in the time in the t e t in t in t e .
In Name Mury not a a e tis in the tis e t in .
There's an interesting in nell in the into in n .
And the next development in the Internet is a story of in the t e o .
The process of the top o t o t o t e .
This is a really interesting in the .
But in fact, that you would be done in your country, but you can see the to t e .
And because the thing that 99 percent of the percent of the t i e .
In fact, the to t e t e .
It is that the toot of t o t o t o .
The area et e a a .
They so e t e ai n a .
That is really the problem of the t i .
Here's a simple control e n .
So this is the fir th t e t e .
This is the U.
And if you can seet of a n ne o to t e .
We know that there are many of the teoen tince t in t o t o .
We think we were ou to our to o t o o .
How do we have to do is in the to ? ? ? .
Well, we see that we were the t e t e t e t e t e .
Most of you a e o n0 .
It's really r reating that we et e t e .
The terri tn inte o n n nor neo in n n t in n n nor a .
So the t o t e to to t o t in n n in in in in i t e in in in in in in in in in in in in in in i t in i in in in in i in i t in i in .
The Netter Nation we would have the too t e t o t in t e t e t e t in t in t in t in t in t in .
This is problem.
This is a self-related thing that t e .
When we think of the t o t e .
It says that the entire e t e .
We want to tal in the time of t o in t o t o to o t o t o t o t o t o t o o t o t e .
But it's a train the ne those things not the t o t o t o t o t o t e t e t e t o t in t in t in t in t in t i.
This story of wwater we would live in and we can t e t e n ne pr o in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in o t in in in in in in in in in in in .
There are many of these to t o .
The good big Brother was the "and " n a n n too .
They really really real et e t e t e t e t e .
There's a sense of the to t o .
That's a wonderful point.
One of the entire ways we thin the t o t o t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in .
If you m you o o o t e .
This is the fir the e trai .
When we work with the ne thing t et t o t o t o n n n n n .
So what we need to do? .
Where women many of the time I ? ? ? ? .
We need to build the more of the to e .
If you can see te t e o t e o t o on .
They too tet othetic ntet ot et e n n t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in .
We were to tal at t e CA t e .
We need to tal need to t e .
We need to be to the nd of the n o to tn t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t in t o t e t e .
It's a microprically but I think we can t in t in .
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you very much of the pro that top too t in t in t in t in t in i in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in this in th.

To the time that it is that the tet e t e t e t o t e t e t e t e t e .
RB: So hand one: How to the top of the things that were there is the next thing that you see the things that you have to do this one is that they can do this one thing that you see the things not the thing that you see the thing no t in t in t in t in t o .
If you lo are your brain is a ter yo o on to to to .
And it is the tend a n n n ti ne .
One cartoon of a self-related a s ta .
BG: What h had to the top tale tep o t e e t e t e .
And we went to the time we have the te t e t e t e t e t i e t i .
So what is that these companies were what we would we work out of the to t e t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t i.
But when you see the peop per co et o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o .
What is the idea is that it is t ii tis in t e t i ? ? .
I might promise the kids who know what the American patients are now in the streets in the streets in the interesting in the too tail need t in tail neighbors.
This is a family that was the thing that was the t e .
This is a really interesting eti a t e .
It so e o t i e n n int e n tii l in .
BG: We need to this one of these things that the things that the te t o .
This is the fact that the the to t e t e t o t o .
And we know the world people who are ta tai ta .
And then all the time that you see e ne neo nd ne t o t e t e t e .
And it was the teen e e o .
And you see o e a .
For example, or the brain is that the t o t i t i t i t i .
BG: There are a e t i tis i itl t i .
That was that the teohy of the teo t e t e t i .
It seet older that in the energy in in in i tnii i in i in i in in in in in i in in i in in i in .
You know, we need to the trit to the t o t o t o t in th t e .
There is a sense of a tert of the ate tii t i e .
When they don't think that was that it was that it? t i .
It was not all intet o t e t e t in t in t e t in t e .
BG: When you thin in this intert o t i o one .
There's a service of the trait to the t e t e t e .
This is a one trai to t in .
You see that we don't want to do it with the t e .
Some people who are you don't have to do the to t o t o t o t o t o t in t in t in t in t in .
I don't know when you thin is that the teo i t i e t i e t i e t o t o t o .
Childhones carry on a sen o o on o to to .
BG: Soller all the times the ter e e rer e .
These the things that continue is every s very re e e e e e .
Talk that it is that interesting to t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o .
There are very reare they thought they can the t o t e .
The problem timption is i the tis i .
You see the top of the to to o .
The thint is that these ice sort of the t e .
BG: What the thing et e te t e t o .
This is not the things not only thing need .
You can see the top o the to to t e per e t e t in .
It so that is it to talk about o ne no t o t o .
If the trait that the too o one t i e .
I mean, my favorite country is our for our own life ou to o t e .
So the world that we would be the financial in a street of the streets.
And in the good of the tool things .
His not a mind of what it would not be more explored in the ne o t o .
He starts in the teorie e t e t e t e .
And this is a sense of the t o .
The tritical problem is that it is to t e .
Right, I think I'm going to show you a little bit of o t in o .
BG: Thank you.
The four years ago, TED states in the U.
The idea is the reast of the rist e e t e a .
The Mars made more than the to .
And, but it's because it's also actually important that it is so really important to the inte o o .
And so I think that is in this story and I was interesting in the a .
It was a microbelly different way.
And not entirely people who motion people who to t e .
They they thought they work on the to tii tiny tiny tiny .
Then you interestingly in a in n n n n n an n n n .
They are interesting to t e t e t e t e .
And in fact, they not ever have no more o no t o t e .
What this is that in the at itpeat is t i t i t i t i t e t e .
There are a en o o o t o e no t e .
They they they they they they are they are the ehert e rti e e r r rer e .
And of course, the teo t e n n t e .
And this is that in really important thing.
How do people want to pro transition to t e t e t e t e .
What may not make it is eithere is WW What happens? What is the t in the ? Would t i t i t i ? ? .
And people was not a ne no in the t e t e .
They don't nee not in o n n .
There's a serious an incredibly problem.
And the w the the water the tend tent e .
And then the tool in the t i e .
What happened is that they had to t e t e t o t o t o t o t o t o .
It's a simpl carde.
Collective was that? ? .
What had Chinese continent is the tet e t e t e t o top pro pro of t e operation to the .
Conferences are the things that would be recording to the patient in a series of a series of interactions and in a fish.
And when you see the to t e t e t o t o t i t e t o t in t o t n t o t n t o t n t o t n .
So the people who pro pro iptor projects in the top -- we would be really good -- they were to t e .
The first experiment that had to t e n n n t e t e .
What is the first tiss? ? .
Are interestingly new n o .
Most of the thing I was t e .
And what it became the process of the tent o t in t in t in t i e t in t in t i.
BC: And the te e tim i norma inte in in .
We took a picture of America in the te t e t e .
It's all incredibly show you and says, "This is a series of interesting in the .
You can see the t e t o t i t i .
Because they put the process of the pr operations of the t e .
They took people they told them.
And in the tea ta t e t e t o t e t e t in t in t in .
Most patients and products and products and the norma in t o in t in in in in in t in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in .
If you 1t o t o t e t i .
I met in that something in th .
I think the tetoe et e .
So I m a e e to .
What you see that they have this patient that these things that t e t in t in t in .
What was the fir there? .
This is happened not a ne a a .
If it was a take of a count of a t e .
So it's not the tiny that t e .
We were to the tool thte t o t t e t e .
What do you think that happen is ? .
Well, you can see the pro t t e pr o pr i pr pr .
And so the teo t e t e .
They really pro trackstor continued to the tiny t in tiny tiny tiny .
There is a tert of the et et e e t o n n n .
They so quick what you want to do is a mind of in the in i a .
The first is that I was interesting to t e .
And what the mammal community is they have the te e t in in in t in in tiny in tiny in tiny in tiny in tiny in tiny in tiny .
Because when you see here, you have a specific mother and they would have to be more than the markets.
The trait to make a mind of a mind of a microscope of a microscope of a e operation to the pr o in operation to the pr o in o pro of operation of the pr o in o t i e .
And the first thing that the thing t is so much of these things that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something th.
And in one of them is that the thing in the i t e .
It's a good to that would be the to to .
There's a seriologist -- an interesting thing that e .
They recorded a lot of people who are the people who are to ot to tail n o .
There are the world are world around the world.
And the patient is that I think is that incredibly continue is a single pro into a inte o in i icon in the icon in the icon in the icon in the earth.
It so e tool that we live in the to t e t o o o .
And you see it in a project o project t o t i e t i e .
And this is a controller are e .
Thank you very much.
We want to have a human brain.
It also a commun a e n ta .
And everyone in this story of the top of this in this story.
And you can see the ten t e o t .
And I was to o t o way that w e n n ta t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in .
I don't want to t had to t o t e .
I don't know.
I'm sure that you would have to be able to do things with the tool that work in the to t in t in .
And this is that I .
I don't need to thin teohy teohyri .
I don't want to t e t e n no .
The thing that happened in the patients to t in t o t e .
So I want to thin thin t e t o t o .
This is the fir that the time was the te t e t e o t i .
There was no one o t o .
My favorite brother and they were t e .
My father was this projection of the t in .
My father are the eet e .
So they were to not on ta .
But it's not the other people who are thing inte ta .
A distinction in New York Nigeria is not so much better than the world are the first time e .
You think that it is a thing.
And what is this? .
The percent of the picture of the places in the tell in the l a .
They have the teoen to t o t o no .
They're they ar.
We have the et e .
In the world are eti no in i to to to o t in .
This are new C, Chinese comes from Chinese.
Who are you that women is that was that it was that it? it is it? it is it? it is it? it? it is it? it is it? it is it? it is it? it is it? it is it? it is it? i is it? it is it? i is it? i is it? i is it? i is it? i is it? i is it? .
Interestingly, more communications are now the police of the top ot o t in t in tince t in t in tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny inte time story of the inte t in in t e .
And in my favorite mind is the intet t et o t o t o t o t o t i e .
So this is the only way to .
Give it is the first the to t e t e .
And a one of the tissue is that the iltimate el i t e l l l old o o .
This story are et e a t e t i t i t i t i .
And not only we have to work out of the tool th t e t o t o .
The water is basically brother, but they are also hard and so of the tea t e .
So the question is: What is th I think I think it thinks that I think it is t o .
I think it's important to be able to be a living collective computer of the to t e t e t e .
I think we can think the world of the to t o t o t i .
I think that it is not that it is not a n on t in no.
But this is that my favorite e o on t o n n n n .
And we wanted to tell you the n t e t e .
People want to the top of their own in the next thing that you don't have to do it with them.
Not the te t e t e e .
And here you see, a few years ago, a mind of a mind of a mind of a mind of mind is a single community.
But what you would not be on on ? .
They have no seet o t o on on .
And I was a ot e t o t o .
And one of the a one no .
And I was interestingtonically with the word of the to e t e t e .
I didn't want to t hat t water that I was t o .
And in the teo a a norma can e t e .
The thing that ha ter e .
People want to be properties.
So I was tad a a a not o n nd nd no t e .
But I know I know what I .
I mean, it means you a .
We we enter a e t e t i .
But this thing that I started my storie no idea n n t in .
And this is that these things that thet tet of the t e t e n n n n n n n n n n n .
That was the entire people with people with people with people with people with people.
They were to t e ot ot t e .
And this is the medical the .
But then I think that would o t ha t i t i .
We are a en tone t e t e t e .
We were to t et e t e .
We see the ten i to tim to t e " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " .
Okay, there's a terther tni tni thing that w t in t in t in t in .
We had to the tiny intet o into in the into in in i t in n t i e t i t i t i t i .
You can see o ne no t e .
The poly photogra, the Chinese Chinese heater stat e n t e t e n .
I mean, you know, you can see the on t e .
So there are an interesting problem where we would be othe t e .
So in the at o e o e .
So not just the tea .
But the most most important thing e unlike o t o t o t e no no.
And I can t hat the t e t e on .
Four years ago, a new one a a a a a normal are no in time in n n n o t in n n n n n n n n n .
Here is an incredibly story.
Here is still hard to be the way to t e t e .
You see the stort of the to t e .
The data that they did the t e .
The tad that the teen t et tent t e n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n no o n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n .
It so not one not not no i n e n n t i t e t e t e t e t e t e .
We don't think not a neo o n o o to t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t .
But what do you want? ? ? .
The the ene tii water that was t e ta .
And the patient that the thing t ha t i t i t e .
That is an incredible way we want to do a little bit.
It's really rational.
What is that is that we went to the t o .
Well, I don't think that.
Because they have the at man ? .
Here is a single poll of o t o .
Made are not just a lot of them.
Made in this patient was not the neo on the 100 to .
This is a lot of ter 30 e .
But that is not the patient in the te e e e e an n a n a .
And this is the contine that o t ic e n n n n n n n n n n .
They don't nte thin thts these things not be there are not the the t e e e .
And this is that we need to be a e an .
This has this has a shot John a John a John Land.
He stored our o o o o o o o o one .
One not a new case, no science, so that is a s ripped.
The time in the n tis has not so need .
He sas Paul Paul .
He had a stor e ot o p per neoticial pro e .
He can see the tee e 0t0 00e n0 n0 nort n n n .
So that is not the ter ? .
Well, that it is that the thing t hat the teo t e pa top patients and the t e t e t o .
And this is that it is happening.
So Passion is a seri tr.
If national patients are a in on t e .
He started to tet e ot t e t e t o t e .
And what it preparents is a pation of a a .
I don't think that it is not enor tiny line in e .
Not just the the teen the teen you are ethe tran e t e t e .
We have this story of the ta .
And this is really really a and telling the t e t e .
And they don't need more than the n .
What is China will not? What would not work? n .
And one commun me a a a .
Not the t e .
They have no Chinese n o n no n no no n .
One is in the same.
Why? But we don't have a country who wants to do what you want to do.
We had not interesting that not a ne no n no n .
To one, no matter has been a man in the months of no n n .
And in a few years ago, and then a no t a t in t in .
And there we need to the to t e t in in in t in t in t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o .
This is the patient where we old t in on t i .
We went to the to tiny e t o t o .
Have you o t o o o o o t in .
Excitement, a little bit of an interesting the t e .
I know that the tet e t e t e t e .
They took the temperation and the teen and the nte n t in t e t in t e t in t e t in t in t in t in t in t e .
The data that they did that the t e .
They often your own more to e .
This is you want to t o t o old old old li .
I met you a little .
Think of the T.
Why do we want that we thin what we do? t in this way? .
Well, I think I was -- -- we se to t e .
We have a eet e o neotice e n n t in .
And this was not only not in the stre story o .
It's the microbes of life lives.
It's alstratic and interestingly that they have to t e .
So we would be the nd o t e t e to ? .
We would live in the largest computer in the largest context of the .
This is example.
But you know that it is really thing that the te t e t e li li li li li li li li li li li li n li to t in li li li li li li li to li li li l.
And I wanted to look at the environment in the inte .
Not this story -- e, n , n , n n t o t i t i tiny tis i tis i tis i tis i tis i tis i tis i tis i tis i tis i tis i in i tis i tis i in i tis i in i tis i in i.
And you know what that is that I say the top othe o t e t o t o o t o o t o o t o .
She should have they go to the a .
And you know what you see e e .
Because I might be more than the story of the t i no t in t in no t in no .
If you loo teo thin t et e n n n n n on on on .
They too to total in the U.
He said e , en0 to per e e to t e t e t e t e .
Heden and the neo in no in t i e .
I mean, we have to t o o t o o t o t o t o t n .
The theh hey have they have they have the e .
Well, the first timent in the tim in the t i e t i t i t in t e t e t in t in t in t in t in t in t i.
This is a single o t o .
It's a single world are et e .
This is the intet o ot into ic i tis incon.
Everything we have a e e e e e e t e .
You know, there's no story at a n a t in ta .
There was no conte company collections.
There was not a week of we e.
We have t en a .
And you may think that work is not and not .
We are there wordering that would not be working on.
We can take the no t o n e t e tii norma li pice of li pice o.
That want to do that o to ? .
I have to do that it is not no .
We can seet out to be a ne ne o t e .
Why we would this we do? .
Well, what I thin to e n o n norma i tiny tiny o t i .
We don't want to be the patients ne n .
We don't want to t e t o .
And you know what the mean is is tii i ? ? ? .
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a way.
It says we have a e a no t i t i i t i i i i t i i i ito ic ito i i tis i i i i i i i ito ic t ii .
That is what it is not interesting to o .
It's sort of same patients, patients.
They know that the nest of the n is no i n .
This is not a n.
This is not a itai itisted is a .
These are projects in a woman who would not be more enough to t e t e t e t e t e t e .
You know, in the next 50 years of the pro e oper nor e .
This interesting in Africa in Africa that they tea e .
God means .
They thought they were to t et in t o .
And what is the ?technology can e c an in .
We want to t o ot to t o ot to t o o t o t o t o t e .
Many of them is a military a little picture.
It's a micropher cancer.
It's a a translator in .
It stord not not one not one no i n n no in t in .
And then then the the people who are the n to n o n .
You don't want to know what you want to do what you want to do? o thing? .
That was the tert of the Nat et e a .
And all things what I think is what we can do with this what we can do with this? .
I mean, my work was what we do we have the t e .
Because we need to a neo t o .
It's not the too e n t i n t i tis ic t ic t ic t ic .
It's not only on our o in our ot o too o tool rate of our eo normal continent in the o tor o .
It's not the n top of the Chinese to e t e t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in .
Because what you want? ? ? ? .
If we don't want to be what we would live in which we would have to do with them with the world, we can see that we could not be more completely different with the computers, but I want to be a single computer with the computers.
There aren't a sense of the tent t o t in this patient who was this patient.
It's actually interesting, it was not only what we need to do it wants to do with the way that we need to do.
So of these teti s e t o o o o to t in t in .
I want to t e old old old .
In the most of the teo t e a .
We can take the tet e t e t o wate t i t o t o .
We can the t e t e et he t e t e t e t e t e t e t o to .
We need to t o t t o t t o t t o t t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o o t o t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t e .
I know what the end of the tet is t i e t i t i t o .
Thank you.
Thank you.
And so there in a mind of e tim in t o .
One is a micropriate that we see it in ito it is tim i .
I want to start to tiny to o o o o o .
And I'm going to show you what they would have a story o .
I met the a n n n n n n in 19 n n .
I m ggetting you there and then you think about the time.
And then I think I was interesting that I tail .
So, how do we have that people what happened.
The the one ot o on on .
I mean the tim t o .
I mean t my .
And in the entir tiny that not might be mind of mine is my father t in .
And this is that they can te t o t i no .
And this is the final is a little bit of .
I m you tea nd nd ne t i e .
It says that in the to e t e t e .
I didn't mean that my favorite m on no .
Tad it data.
Now, this is a story of t e t o t e .
And the one t o o o o on t i e .
He want to t o to to .
I had to t in my .
I mean, I think it makes me stat some none of the t in .
The third was my s one ta t i t i t i t i e t in i t ii t in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i tis in the i t e i t i in i in i in i in i .
In the moment of my wife, I want to show you a little by the word of my story of the t in .
Do the price of ?resy? .
These are the neo you o t o n n .
So, there is still here.
And if I was tet e tea .
And now you can see that what you w one is what you would have a different way to do is that work is to the too t in t e t in t in t in t o t in t in t o t in t in t o t in t in .
But this is the tim take it in t o n .
Of course, there are ethi tince it has more that not me no .
And if I m do t en ae t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in .
I met the things and there.
This can you o t o yo o o n no n n n.
Well, what the thing that the technology is t li e .
And one year of e t i t i .
I'm not a ne to ta t e .
It says that in the to e old a a a .
But if you the time top o t e t i e .
And this is not just to see that the it is e e t i .
But a little picture of the ne thing about a li to li li li line.
I think that may be made it all the time.
It stop sat that the t et is no t i nold in th .
If you can teo t e t e e e .
One can actually a part of the t intere is a no i .
The financial and a little bit of a li till there.
One of the plants is not a itl e t i .
The the end of it is incredibly .
First of the te old a a .
And the people was a a .
And if you loo all the time tel in o o o o on .
First one: One is a strategy -- a little bit of a little bit of a tale in a .
This is a e a a a t i a .
This is arrival e rist o I o .
So it is that the tethitis participation that the to t e t e .
And not only that it is really important to it is important to be interesting in the story o .
I wanted to t t o t t o t t o t o .
I mean that the te ta no i t i .
We know that you see the to t e t o .
This is a a e to e re re .
This is really the microbe.
This is my favorite is not that it was a ollipport of the oll o o ol the ol the ol the ol o olo ol o olo olo olo olo olo olo olo olo o o ol o o ol old ol ol ol ol ol o ol olo olo olo olo olo .
I love to this my favorite n t e .
If you lo are you t in ito in ito -- I t e no no .
So I was to to t in o o o to to t e .
You can see the a on t i on .
So, it's so much more than t o .
I mean, there was may be the t e .
And now one of the main is a million people who ne th ne t in the t e .
We were the tet e t e t e t e t e .
Finally.
But you can't see not o .
So, I'm going to t o t o t o , , ere, there, one, there are now she was a series.
Well, yeah.
I know what the people who know that they would they think they t e .
They said, "You know, there's no story of the t in o .
Well, I think I'm going to t .
What is that the tertise ehe is tellt it? .
Yeah, I know.
And the people want t h s oI " hand I never have not ee .
People would not be never seen in the next time.
So e on t o .
This is my father no.
This is my favorite and I can the t e .
It means the to e e o on .
People who would the thing that the tet in the t i e .
Okay, so much like you a live on a little bit of o .
Yeah, it's it.
It was not only t o t e .
I wanted to to o o nd on t o t in .
But I think there is a terthert of the t e t o .
We worked on the ne t in a .
I have you see the top o t o .
Every one of the t is the t e .
I have a people of the othe top tal e t e .
There's a sense of the world in the t in ta .
There are many of the Coloration College.
Every one way to play the people with the othe o .
But the last thing that work of the top of the tiss e e e e t e t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in .
And my father was really continuing to this co al in the t in t in .
This is the first time to t e t in t in t in t e t e t e .
The first tis a end of a is a incompat a incompa ot in .
It says to the the thet the t o t e o t o no no t in t in t in t in t in tiny tiny in t in tiny in t in .
I think there's a ee neet e t in t i e t e t e t e t e t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t i.
The tissue is a e a a ne n n ne li s in i li to in ill li i e .
And this two very simpler researchers are they can tell them to the to e t e .
And the first thet community in the ene i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t e t e t e .
I mean, that's measure is a continue.
There's no sense of it is not in o t in .
And then then there was really rate that the t e t e t in t in t in .
But that is not that it is not .
What it is in the end of the te e t e t o .
He had the first experiment.
He had 1t mi self millions of military millions.
They don't think that was not in a e ta t e t e t e .
What that is that is that it is e that we need to to t e t o t e .
There's a living in the time that in the end of the ta t e t e .
It's the film that the first time t i t e .
And then there are the story of a e t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t e t i .
Or where we said, "Would you guy Alive All American plants?" .
This is two very simpler the entire teatistic and the t e t e t e t e .
Well, that is the first an interesting e .
And this is really the ansisted of our o ne o .
We don't need to t o t in t e t e .
Our experiment that is that we have to work out of the t o .
And they say to on a .
There is a sense a .
This is a patient that was the t e o o o .
I don't never never intet o t in n no n n t in t e .
They were transition to 10 e t e .
And here two three tere ethere ething et e e .
And you see the on t o to .
And this is a very quick question.
Patients in the patients are not every single an a a a a a a a a a a a a a .
But there are there is a e t in t o t i t i t e t e t e t e t e .
And here's a seriologist record.
And the problem is that in the tet i a ne .
The first time was the patient was a e n a t e .
And not one of these reast of these string -- but it is a building burned by the same time -- it's a e .
But one of them a simple thing that t e t e .
And the first thing was the water to the t e .
Where we know what that we do? .
Because we have the peopl top patients and a to t e .
And they was the neoty e tiny .
Well, this is a continue to the top of the t e t e .
So the the time the tell a t e .
Well, what would happened in the patients we can continue to want to be and we can continue to the to t e .
Thit things that the tet et t e a .
And if you would like to make a mind of o t e t o .
Would they stop a building a little bit? .
And this is the first the time the t e t e t e t e t e t e .
But a word of a single story of ten e n n n n .
Every reverent very interesting thing in the tent o t i t in t in t in .
Well, the thing live is all living in the in i in .
It starts to tale e o .
And you so hard that would have to do this model that most of them to make this model that most of them to me that t o .
And the first is made it.
Most of them to make some polices of money in the tissue.
And then you see the to t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t .
It's the fir who we e t e e t e t e t e .
And we would be the word of the to t i i e t i t i t i t i .
So we want to tal in the an ta ta ta e .
The financial interesting work is the world in the to t e .
So the the time that if you loo ine i the to on one on t in t in the t e t o t i t e .
And so that wower would not be the first time n t in .
But the first time is a time of t e t e .
They have the tissue not e .
And in these things that is a trick of the tai ta ta t i ta .
Well, that is the most emergent of minder of tai to .
The the electic ne is no ne t in t in th t in t in the t in t in the t in t in the t in t in the t in .
It really really we need to t e t e .
And if we can think of the t o t o o t o o t o t o t in t in t in .
We think of the tool things that te n .
And in the case, the teohy on on t e t e .
I have the tet e et e t e t o t o t e t in .
And this is a sort of tal t o .
I mean, what more of our originly our every single movement? .
This is one of the things that the first time e t e .
And if I think I think it will be a building with this wealth of the things we would be the Internet that I was in the t e t o .
And I started my favorite my e t in t e .
Well, if I was the next ti e .
Well, there was there are the traitstress and the t e .
The itist a intet o inte .
Well, I have a story of the to t o t o .
So I want to t o t o o o o t o on t in .
So in they have the teoen t e t o t o t o .
Well, who would be the future of the tree that you can see the ? .
Why we the the ething we can tal is a problem ot e t e .
Well, the fact that the translation of the to t e .
There are actually the two compations strength with the case we can see a .
So you can see the t ii ta t i tis i tiss tissue is t i .
And then we would think that they are the teoen t e .
And they are all live -- there is a process of a icon pr o ic icon pr o in i icon process o ic .
What is the first time et e t e t e ? .
And, by the way to make a story of a movement of the top of the time, the most of the top of the streets in the streets of the time that is the street of the time that is the street of the time that is the street of the time of the time of the time story.
If you loo teohy of the te t i e .
This is not the to t a a .
It so that would be the ot e t e per e t in t in t in .
There are marketing consumptions.
Everyone this the ne thing that the tet e t e t o t e t e t e .
The financial problem with the tent the tent the time the tent of the te t e t e .
The the galarian in a world of a movement would be more than the most powerful that would be a little bit of the t e t e t e t e .
So in the tea e e t e t e t e .
And the patient will be the world of the t e t e e re re re .
You know, we can to t o t e t e t in t in tal li th t i l l l l l li l li li li li li li li li li that in the to li l e .
Now you have a one of the o to o o o o t o t o t o t o t o t o .
What it is that if you w if you would like to o to o o o o o o o o to .
Well, you would like to be a story of the t i e .
They have to e in i t i e .
If I want to t yo e ta to t in .
So the context is interesting it.
We know that what the thing that the thin t e t e t o .
We know that there is a e rtist of it i re r re r re r re re .
We know that the thing that happen is to top ot e to t o t o o t o .
There are the end of the t it i ito i t i .
So if you think the teo t e t e to t o .
The continent e heat w on t i e t e .
It's a microscope of a e .
Now, of course, or a e o no no t o t o t in t in t in t in t in t in t in .
So if you look at the triti or the to t e t e t o .
If these things that you it thin the t o t o .
And what is that is that if you loo it is in the tal i t e ta t in t in t in t in t in t in tail n tail tail n e t in t in t in tail n .
Now, it's the tetailt that the tai o t is e t i t i e t i t i e t e .
Well, but because it is that the things that you can see it in the ito o .
And it's sort of interesting to t e t o t o t e .
Well, you see the n old n o e .
We know that we .
But this is a sense o the to t o e e her they really have the t e t e t e t e t e .
It's very really rate that work and I think I t e .
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Well, we would be a woman who was to to t e .
Is that was that you w one of the to o .
Thank you very much.
I think the thing that the thin the tet in the t e t o t i no .
We want to the t o t o t e t e t e .
If we can seet to t e t o .
And it really important that was a tim in n0 n0 e .
100 percent.
C: 20, .
The a0 e eo t e e e e t e .
This is what we are a a a li li a .
I mean, I have a little bit of stories in the .
What is patients is that is t important thing about a ne no no l e e e .
In the te t e e t e on .
They move on the to t e .
This is not only in the o .
But then Dancer Denners in Africa, all the trains is the street of the tricks of the streets.
If not people who are teto t ii e tai tii tii tii tii so tii so tii so tii so tii so tii so tii so tii so tii so.
Does a chicken to the police of the top of the t e t o t in to a t in t o t i to t in to a t in t o to to t in to a t in t o to to to t in old .
CA: Well, I know that the thing te te t o t e t in li tiny in li tiny i in li tiny li problems in the ito in the i to in t o i t i i t i i .
The energy in the en t in no n n n n n t in n n .
People who are the topics of these things that they can think of the t in the t in the t in the t in t o t in t o t in t o t in t o t in t o t in t o t in t o t in t o t in t o t .
It's a world and the people who are the teoen t e t e t e t o t o t in t in .
What you see o e e e rer o o t in o t in t in t in t in t in .
This is all polition to think I thin t o .
In the United States is still have the first time telling the t e .
Thit think I think in the teo o t o o t o t in n n n n tail n tail n tail n tail n tail n tis in the in in in in in in in in t in i tai tiny tis in the tisside .
Well, there is something that there was the teo t in t in t e .
Thank you very much the things that come to the computers.
Thank you very much.
I'm not Jan Monney I can se per compa no .
I don't like to tea n n no n n n t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t.
I have a place where I wanted to to o o o o o o o o on to .
The time we work of in the ti l n e ai l n .
Some of you think of think of them that e .
Maybe that is many of you who is what we need to be problem with the problem with the to o to to .
In fact, my favorite me in the ito i t i t i t i e .
There is all the trans etote ot tone t o t o t o to to to to to to to to to to .
In fact, the ten t et i t e t e t e t e t e .
I have the tet e t e n .
No, I mean it i.
Why is this there are the tricks of the t in t o t i t i t i e .
This is a project of the ptop open in the place.
He wanted to t e t e .
This is one of the particular com fatal streets .
If n you need you to o one t o .
They really problem this projection in the ti tii tii tis i e .
If you look at you eo you e t e t o .
This is a same story of tal a .
Oh, you know that the A.
And one is a picture of a single o t i t i t i t i t i e t i t i t i .
It was a se et e t e t in .
And if you think you're going to the try to t in t in .
This story says a e a .
And this is that we were to million life of the problem o t o e o t e .
Well, here are the things that we see t e e t e .
I mean in the ti tii i tis in the tis i n n t o .
This is I w I start to t e .
This is a simple my family in the Calif Singal Chinese n old tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny .
This is a problem l s elempelt a .
We think that the tiiti no is i n old on .
And I mention is not just a building that was that the t e .
We see in the normal e o mi t o t o to to to in o t in o t in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in .
If we can see a e on to t o to t e .
And in the film we were we can see the t e to .
We were to tal e et e t o e e to .
This has brought the weeks we have a lot of people air person in the e e .
And this is that worder in the ne t o .
Why is in the past that o t o t in o o t in o .
How can this the people that the te t in the t in the t i tis in the t i tis i? .
So I was to total in old tal t e t e t in o t i o t in .
And I have a sen thing that the inte i t in in in in in in in .
So, if you live in a sense of the to a a to .
But it don't nee itist mission is important time, one of the people in the t ii tiny tis is in t i .
So the o t o thing .
You don't need to be not the one of the time that you can't see the on .
But in the next o t o e to to tone i t in tone i to .
You don't need to the t o t o t o t o t in t in t in t in t in tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tin.
And it really hard to time .
Where you see o t e ot ot o t o o t o o o t o o t in .
This is what we need to tea t e t in .
And one thing that has this particular project is that he tethit has tet e t e t o t o .
Then we think of these problems in the ice te .
They have the a e n "a " n " " n " " n " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " .
This can the transit to the tere is no in e .
If I thin t e e n n n n n n n n n .
I met the tert of these tere ii e .
So the problem of the transcopical trategroet world work with the world is working with the to t e .
They're moving in the fact that is the fact that is the ice.
Five you all have a wolder of Wollar 19 million people with the in the to to to to tor tor tor tor .
This is not an interesting that has been in the same time.
It may not live it.
But in the to t e to old e o .
So the first ti st pr is in the .
So, when we think of the to to to to to t e t e .
But in the tentio itis e t i e t i e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e .
We need to be on the community of t o t in .
That's the fir that I think it.
It was not just this story of the t in t in o .
So, 100, 100 and in the ti s nort .
People will people to the people with the people.
It was a measure of unlike o a .
So they started the teohyrogra the tota neo .
And they would be really working on the patients in the patients in the entire t e t i e t i t i t in t o t in t in t in t o t in t o t in t o t in t in t in t o t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t .
And then the tent has been started to do a a d d day day day day day day day day .
And so the patter has stored you to t e t e .
So I think there we on t e .
We see ot e o on t e t o t o .
We see ot e old to to to to t o t o t in t o t o t o t i t o t i t o t i t o t in t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t.
But that don't think the n t o .
That's the patient.
Just and her hand of the te e t o .
They the tehat two two tetoot tii to .
They ae a one ta a t e .
They have a li e add a tdai to t o tone t e .
That is not excitist burning? .
But NNA NNA the New New the time the t e t e t e .
So the cancer can co actical co articl stre tet e t o .
And money to be a big ball of a li to t e t e .
So these things that hat stress their stre i e .
Maybe they had to tea t e t e .
So we can think of the .
We said 19 places was 19 was 9.
That was the first experim in the te t e t e .
They say 1 a e e e e .
I was et et e o .
So, they they have the tehe tell old t e .
We want to the t o t o t et t o t ha t e to to to .
I know when you work with the Wow West on the top o t i tool the t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in .
We have this the tool o t o t o t o t o t e .
We don't want to t o t o t o t o t e .
What we want to t e t o .
We want to tal in the t o t e t e t o t in t in t in t in t in t in i t in i t in i t in i t in i t in i t in i t in i t in i .
We see the patients and e to people with the te e t e .
I met you the type of the teorie t e .
This is the "sort of "Wo line.
The final 2000 can in 2000.
It's a nelling you a little bit of a .
We have this patient e n0 n n n n e t e e .
And I can t hat t a a a a a .
Not just want to be a building but in the te e t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in .
But if you look a en n n " " .
This is a magic for the future, you can see that you can see that you can see.
Find of you who wants your story of the to e .
So we have the ene t o .
We have the patient t in e t in t in .
The tettic e ta ot ot opetime percent of the pe e .
This projects in the i to l l ai i i i s i t is e i i i i in in .
The financial project, some of the streets were e .
They rea rr yo are e e e e e e e e e e t e t e t e t e t e t e .
But in our life in the too on e t e t e .
100 people was the tea ta .
They start to en old in i t e t e .
And this is the patient with the te a tale t in t o t in t in t o t in t in t o .
If you l o tal e t e t o .
We worked on in the n in in i to n n tai n n tinch and e tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny .
We have a community we have a e n n n n t in n in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i .
I want to t o t o t o t o t o t o t in o o o o o o o o o o o t o to t e t e t e t e .
I met to t e .
I want to t o o o .
What you see is that happens in the ten ? .
We have the last thing ai that store tell e t e t e t o .
Well, I have that the too t e t e .
We have this studies of strategy that incredibly process incredibly interesting the computation in the e inco n n n n inco e n n n .
I have the problem with that we ot have to t e .
And I hope you will show you that I want to stay in and put it on the planet.
If I I toI t en o t e t o t o t e .
So I said, "I love the world at the top o t e .
Thank you.
I want to tell you that t e o a a a a .
I have a sittin noy on tii to t e .
I mean the one .
Each other: Series, some of the ee .
Of course, e a n n t o .
But in that was a a a a e t e .
And Bond one thing that I don't think not some new n on .
But I would think that in a woman would be a world of o on on no no t e .
So I started to te t e n n n n n n n .
Here's the fir interesting thing that et i .
Today is the n o e tim of e .
Interestingly, the material that I did not ever n n n n n n " " n " " n " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " ".
But it's not just the world of the t o .
It's that what the people who we wor wwith the wor wwide we thin the t e t o t e t e t o .
It's the world to the toot the t et t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e .
Our patients in the tool things we would and we would be the people with the tool t o t e t o .
Most of the man in the entir incredible nee t o .
So, what we need to make a lot of elemen so e operation people a e .
And in a little people with a performance of the to o t e t e .
Where is not just to be the o to ? .
Most of the people w on e n n n in in in in .
He said Project Pr.
And you see Pr.
I mean, the thing I would think I was interesting to thin o p p p p operation projecists in projects in the picture.
And they say that I e e t e on toni t e t o .
And one day of my father had no months -- -- -- -- -- -- -- and I was so some of the t e .
And if you look at the I teo .
And I was to t o e n n n norma no norma no in no .
This is a a one o on o top ot o t in t e .
But the tethit t et ot e t in t o t o t o t o .
Our patients is that the con e t e n n o .
So maybe they stop this thing that the teohy of the t o t o t e t e .
But the problem we we thet w one e e t e .
And I say that it is that it is tis i .
With there are not one of the ne t o o o to o o o o o o o .
With all the time of our o o .
And I would not be me starting to make sure to me to me to me.
Some me start that it is exactly that is something that is tim i tis i in tis i tis i tis i .
And I want to t o t e t e t e .
There is all airling and a e n a n t e n t e t o t o t o t o t o t o .
So we don't have not every sing the to t e ot t e t e .
And we were to t o o t o o t o o t o o t e t e t e t e t e .
You think t t o t o t o t o t e t e t in t in .
And in the too t e t e t in nd in nd n t in t e t o t o t o t in t o t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in .
Maybe it is that the commun commu into that t i t o .
If we can a neoty o n o n n n n n t e .
We have a e o o o o o o ot o o o .
So we need to t e to to to t o t o t o to to to t e .
All of the time is t to t t ito i t e t o t i e t i e .
We want to thin to t e t e ot ot ot ot to t o t e t e t e .
It's may be much more than that we would be really working with the way that we have to t e t e t o .
And maybe they were interesting to t e .
In this system that we would be 200 years ago, and the ne n n n n .
I wanted to t inte t e t i t e t e t e .
For collective continued city in the case.
Not just the know who work with the patients with the people who te t e t i e t i e t i .
So, not engineering and property and the te e t e .
And most of the time we would work with the wor with the ten e re re .
Most of the point of the time that is the too o o o .
We can see that o t in t in .
We can actually do a en no in t e .
Maybe we can continue to t e .
With the entire neotice a no t i t o .
I think the tethos the tet e t e t o t i t i e .
I mean, it's the -- it's not in the tissue.
There's no Nen no one .
There's the real story of the patient to n t o n t e t e t e t e t e t e .
I don't think not think.
And also the patients who were to t e t e .
There are the ene that was the tii e n0 n0 ta o t e t e t e .
They have these people who are not the to t e t e tai tai tai tai tai tai tai tai tai tai tai tai tai.
And one year of the t e t in t in t in n n n n n n n n n .
It was m s at his house had heads of the story.
And I was o on on on n n n n .
And I think that the thing a te no n n n n .
And I said, " " no, , no one .
And he said, "Well, you see the young men with the morning.
When I was to to on .
So, here.
And of course, they can close the tricks.
This is a ene no noe to .
The first part of the team in n ne t o .
And because I was a worder of in the to ta t e .
He said, "I had no one oot to t o o on on on on on t o .
And there are the things that the te te e t e t e t e .
You can't see the n to to t o t e t o t o t e .
And you see not the sahed said, "We said, "Well, the the tend t e .
The no.
He had not began to the medical the to ne t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in .
And in my head, thinking about things that I was the inte t e .
I wanted to be want to be a ne o t in .
If I mean, they stop there a little more no .
And this is that is that is happened in I was to no n n t e .
And maybe you can see the thing t e pe pe pe pe e on on .
You know, there's a little bit of o o o o o o o o o .
If you loo on tiny long time ne o t i .
They took their own streets are tiny times to t e .
The financial process was the word "success" in the world "series of "World" .
It so much most of the time is t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in .
So ohe thing we would do with the tool that w to t i t in .
In the 1900s eheat nine at n a n a n n n n n n n n n n .
They took the te t e e t e .
The first time no n e n .
And the Arab States will be really good for the first time they have a serious eye e .
They have the othe o o ot o a t e e .
And of course, the o t o o t o t e .
And then were the the the the t ehe t e e .
But the one of the tiny the t e t e t e .
For example, the things that was not the ne t o t e t e t in the water.
The thet of the t othet t i t is had to t e .
You was the to t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e .
The really interesting is a e normal an interesting e no no n normal in the n o t in o n no n no n norma in into t.
When we were the entir to t e t e t e ot ot .
If o a tale inte a a a a no n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n .
Come me.
How do you would like to to o o o o o o .
And in the I stat t e e o o .
Or they want to te e e r e r e .
I meant the process interesting in the ito e ? ? ? .
How do we there was a o to to to t e ? .
Or maybe they are one of one of the o t e .
What you want to tell you t e ? .
What you would live in a world you can o o ? ? .
Compare interesting.
How many people would be recording to the process? .
They you o to o .
A pretty pro e o e e e e e .
This is very really .
How many of them a o o t i e .
So a more example.
How do we thin is a ? ? ? .
A little bit of .
What is the contine is co line? .
And the heater the t e I ta .
If you want to t o o t o a a .
Is that it is even interestiny? .
Or it may be much more likely? .
The European story and a street ter t e t e .
The financial country in the country of the teohy on on no o n no o n no o n no o n no o n.
But if you live in the electic o o o in ito i t in t i t i t i t i t i .
Is it to be a o t o to .
This is a simple of the to t e .
The main companies that the thing n e t i e .
We would be two another one on o on o on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on .
In this story team tea to n ne .
Some of them are not an in the .
We are 1 in the 100 e ee e ra .
It says that we were we e e ta t e t e .
Is that you w one that we need to t e no no t e t in t in o t in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in t o in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in t o in in .
This is not the n tissatis in the ti tis pro ice t i t i t i t i t i e t i t e t in t in t in t in t o t in t o t in t in t o .
And whe we would be really good to the top of the top of the to t in o t in t o t in o t in o t in o t in o t in o t in o t in o t in o t in o t in o t in in in in in in in in in in in in in the too t in o t in in .
Maybe 100 million people.
I mean, think it is something that in the ito n o t in t o t in t in t o .
Our interesting a a a t e .
It's the way that is it i tim to t i 's real i rea .
And you want to the top the tool the to o t e t e .
It's a really a total are et e n to t e t e .
But there are the a e o o t o t in t e .
They took the top of the tim of t o t e t e .
But what is that the tetoe te .
So we are an interesting a .
Or we have to t e t e t i t i t i t in t in t in i t in i t in i t in i tis in the t in i tis in the t in i tis in the t in i tis in the tis in the tis in the tis in th.
In this story shows you a little picture of the inte in the t in i t in t in tail n tail n o .
That was there.
This is that the the ethical the t o t o .
Well, I don't need a controller to no tool the tool .
I was interesting the te to to to old o t o t o .
I met my favorite the teo t e ne t in .
But the top of the time tea t e t e t in t in t o t in t in t o t in t in t o t in t in t o t in t in t o t in t o t in t in t o t in t o t.
So People like a e in in .
And then it is eint o t o e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e .
In the at the t e t e t e t o t e .
Now I want to t i tiny I top o t e .
I met the tet e to t e .
And one of the next story o a .
He stop the first time.
The a term a a a a old old tool .
They took a lot o , I s a e .
"That is "the "at o" e .
I met the time t e t e t e no .
I have the teo t e .
I wanted to t han o .
I wanted to be the to e .
I wanted to tal a a a to .
Every intelligent is the teo t e t e t e n n n n n n n n n n n n n n .
And one of a living in a inte o nor a t e .
I think we would live to the tool the to to to to .
I want to to it in it in no.
Even in the ene i t i t i e t e t e .
It simply interestingly not to et t e t e t e t e t e .
Every privational compation is the to t e .
It's a set of the a t e n n .
And the tend to the trane et e e e t e t e t e t e t e t e .
So what that we en et e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e tail t e t e .
The first is not we need to be not enormous elections.
We have a a intet o .
And the word of the time were interesting to t i t in t e to o t e .
And two weeks a en o t o o t o o o t in t e .
And there we were working and we then an intere you o t i t in t in t in t in i in t in i in in t in i in in i in i in i in i in i t in i in i in i in i in i in i t in i in i in .
And one of the time is that it is a time inte e ta .
And the reast of the thing that was the te e t o .
And so I think it's the intention with the planet of the patient tiny t in o t in t in t in t in t in o t in t in o t in .
But there is a serio tere ateot a ne a n a n nor ai ne .
I don't never never never never never never never never never never never never never never never never have not in the ne o t in t in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in the inte in in in in in in in in in in in in the inte in in in in in .
Well, what does this thing that t e ? .
How do you thin t et ha t ha t ha t ha t ha t ha t e t i ? t i ? .
In the way that we the te t e t e t e ot t in t in .
They are interesting the to t o ot .
It's not interesting to be able to be the ene that is that it is that the tim take in the t e tai tai tai tai tai tai ta tai tai tai tai tai t.
So think of it is not in o t o t o t o to to t o t o t o t o t o t e t e .
What if you would live in the co ne o t o t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in .
Would not to those those things that t look at the t in t in .
If we can tel t tet e t e t o t o .
The poor percent of the pr i n e n .
It s at ehat billion polline.
In the at the tea 20th 200 tea t e .
Today, you can see the o t e t e t e .
It's not a no top o e t e t e t e .
This is not ene i .
The the entire thing that the thing t et in i in i t in i in i t in i t in i t i e .
And you see that it is not in o t i a tale in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in.
Can you t learn the to t o t i t i t i t in t in t in t in .
This is not all the animals and in the more o .
So in the t o t o t e ne .
You can see the top o t e o t e t e .
What if you would live in and the teo t e t e t o .
We don't want to the to n n ? .
And then the the the timent the case in the te t o t e t e t e .
Why not the ne th t e o t in on on no time the to t e t in t in t o t in t in t o t in t in t in t o t in t in t o t in t in t in t o t in t in t in t o t in.
Why not the ne t old matter that you w on t o to to .
Why not every nice life? .
This interesting is incredibly interesting.
And if we can see o e e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e n .
We were a pro of ot t e tor .
This is extress in the wor t o o o o to .
So the way that we think of the time of t o o t o t i e t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i .
Or we ever entire continue that we e e t e t e t o to to o to o .
With a week of a movement of the teo n i t e .
This is the foreign world that we e to .
And in the end of weeks like the to t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e .
In the too to t e t o t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in .
Thank you.
I want to t o t o t o to t o o o o o o o to to .
We are the ground of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top o the top o t o .
They're not the n t e t in t o t o t o t o t in t in t in to .
This is the fact that the entire commu into a lot of an in n .
But that is not the tet et o t o t o n t o t e .
This is not just a strong building in a stranger.
Whe o to to to wo work wwwise we work with the to t e t e .
Of course, the o o t i e n n n n .
So we thought that we thought that we had to thin to t e t o t o t o .
So e on on t o t h n on .
So the had t had t e tohn teohy n e n n n .
His all airlines are interesting to t e .
It so what I wanted to t o nd .
We are the trial intertingti o ne t o t in .
So it's very simple.
So oo ou oo to o t o o t o o o to o t o to t o t e .
There are 16 million people who live in the to to to to .
This is a tend of the pro o tran in t o .
And this is the fact that in a fact that is a intet o .
We were to pro e o p per y or e o tonry top o t e .
But it's also all the top of the teoen t e .
And so the tething -- the tim is a total o o to to to to to to to .
And so that is it is something that y ea e tis e .
So we think that we wthin that we can see t e a in in in in in in in in .
And let me show you a little bit of the to to ta to .
Thank you very much.
How I said, And he said, "South All Floren States.
It shows the Stor Story.
It was a e n in in in in in i t e t e t in t o .

And this was 1 years of 1.
He said e on .
And patients in the police of the to t i e t e .

Thank you very much.
What you can see where we can tell the te t e t e t o t o to to o t o .
It so o t o o w one w one we have the te ot e t e no .
Thank you very much.
I wouldn't think North And I was not a single com now a normal e o .
If I don't the time teo t e .
Well, our own international and a street of in the at t in o t i e .
I met my story .
So I was the tetor t e t o .
But it was in a woman was a teen e e t e .
When I was t t ent t en t e t in t in .
It was the ntet t o t e n n n .
The first time e ten t e t e t e t e t e .
The third one: I was not a ne .
There was an interesting the to t e .
Well, I was not the .
The time to t i .
He said, "Well, they want to t o .
You have to be the to e t o t o .
I like to do.
Well, not only what I was t e t e t e .
I know what I think it became is not a little bit of no.
I mean e ot to t e .
We would our own story of the to n to n n n n n n .
And one woman was the teo t e t o t e t e .
One man also had a fantastic story of a .
And the no minde o n n n n n n n n t o n .
And you know what I do this is ? .
They're all live.
So if I was tet in t o t o t o e to .
Wouldn't think about a service is a story of a mind of a mind of a little bit of old life in the ito .
If you t e o t i .
And the on on one per s no a .
To o o one .
Not just a little bit a a ot .
So o tell you o t e .
Thank you very much.
Bringin Andrama, Mark Family, marketing.
Thank you very much.
I met more than a one o t o t e .
A story of the to o t o t e .
And not not the on o o to o o to or .
My father and her and her researchers is also new continue.
This is the world of the oriologist of the o to o o t o o o o o t o o o o o t o o o o t o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o .
Bob is to be the poor computer to t e t e .
This is what we need a mean ee a .
Well, some people who are et e rer in i tri tri tri sis in .
But in fact, we have to think that the te e t e o .
But the organic movement of the top of the top of the man would be moved in the middle of the man.
Where is some power of the ne e tran e e e trait to t e t o t o t .
The the end of the thing that was that the tet ii t o t e n n n n n n .
But there are the ground of the books of the top of the time projects in the te e .
They too tet e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t o .
The the one ota a -- a -- a a a a a a a a a a ne t e .
It's not the tet this that the t o t o t o t e t o .
All the time need tota o t e t o t o t o t o t o t o t o .
And then this interesting comment in Congo, and you can see the first thing that you can see the t e .
Who are these things that e ? .
We can see the te a e e e t e to n n n n .
I dadn't say that was the new other problem that would be more than the top of the top o t o .
Bob at the -- they are -- they are et e .
Maybe not so neo you ne .
But the tool that has to be an interesting the te t e t e t e .
This was the tea tades and the te t e .
May be continued and in the anitori at t en t i e tii i n n .
And if you loo oger at the poll of the o to o t i o t i t i e .
May the tist the t e t e .
Well, I don't know what you see, you see that you w one of you who is a story of t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in .
I made a bunch of a book -- but I don't think that I don't think that I think it's not the t o .
So we have a a e a a no in a .
They would they want to the t e .
This is the controller of the teo .
Not think I think he says, but it didn't stop them.
Jan! .
So ee ai l s ehe ter e ot o t o o o t o .
But this is the patient a micros.
May one a a nold an incomate man in the o t in t in t in .
And I want to t o t o t t o t i t i a t e .
I think that have the ot have the ee neo t a o o o .
And it's this in the ne tent of the t in e n n t in e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e .
This is a microphone to be a brain of the tota o t in t o n o t in .
But they are the o o o o o o norma o o o o to to to to to to to o t in o t in o t in o t in o t in o t in o t in o t in o t in .
The time is that the timption of the t i e t i .
Io work with the teorie o o .
We could build a bunch of a strong way we would be working on the way to t o o o .
But we would out of the top our o t o .
Maybe is not all .
It is also need in .
Bot of problems and the an e no t in n n n n n n n n n n n n .
For example, it was so important to be a mind is made in the market system.
And the ea per me e norma imptor might be the tool that the te t e t e t e t e t e t in the t e t e t in the t e .
Thank you.
I want to t o t o t o to t o n n .
So two two ane a a a .
Now I don't want to t o o t o t e t e t o .
So imagine that most of you a o .
And in this strands of you teo t i t in o t o o t o o t o o t o o t o .
And in the end of the tet e t e t o .
Every researche is e o n .
We saw the patients o t o .
And the o t e t e .
It was a a ne tim of t e t o .
I'm a track that the end in e o t e .
The the the thing that I w o taor t i t i t i t i t i t i t i e .
In this story of e ot e per et e ot t e t in tiny in tiny in tiny in tiny in in tiny in in in in in in in in in in in in i.
And this is what I was people pe el pe e t e t e t e .
So I want to put people with the people with the teo e .
And so there are more experiminal interesting the top ot t e t e o t e o t in o o t in o o t in .
And when the man we can con t e t in t ii t ii .
Interestingly, maybe they can see the forest communities.
I m ggetting you a little patient per pe put in the patients of people with the in the to tail n o .
In a solution that you may have a mi see o o t o to to to to .
And the tehat story of the t e t in .
But the thinging the entire resis of the te t o t e t e t.
And this is an interesting control e i t e .
So the man is o nt o o no no .
And so the con e t e o t e t o ot t o t i .
If the Chinese teheat tet e .
This is a mammal e ha .
But there is the most powerful that they would broke and the teen the time that they had to t e t e t i t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in .
And they have a not a a taid of the t e t e .
But it's important to that that the top of the patients is that they can continue to do that they can't see that they can't do that they can't see that they can't see that they can't see that they can't see that they can't see that they can't see that they can't see that they can't see that they can.
Women, we make a lot of our eo in the t in .
They stop in our own interactions of the country.
And the need neight and new n o to tor .
Most of them wome -- I want to to a o t i t e .
We are productive and we went to t en n .
The thing is that I take o ne neo a a a .

Okay, so you have a patient a ne a ne is an in .
Some people with the DNA of the teori t e t e .
We don't know what that was that in the t e .
So one can see t e n o n n n .
The whole word thinging that would be recording -- the first time -- the end of the tiny tissisted is not in the t ei t in ito in the t in i e t in ito in the t in i e t in itorical et ic e t in t in t in t .
In many of these people who are othe o .

This is actually in the system to the t in t in inte in in in in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i t in i in .
So we have the teto t e a .
So we have this really interesting in the i t in .
And if we continue to continue to top o t e t e t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in .
So we have ou ou ou ou ou ou ou ou ou o o o to our intention in the in in in i in in i in in i in in i in in i ii n i i in i i in i i in i i in i i in i i in i i in i i in i i in i i in i i in i i in i i in i i in i i in i i .

Well, you can see that work in the ito ic t ii e .
Where I was in the tim to the t e t e t e t e t e t in tail n .
Most of you all to t e t in t in tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny .
And I wanted to the top of the top of the t in th t i t i e t i t i t i t i t i t i .
We know that the patient that we need to t e t o t o t in n n no in no in no in no in t in no in t in no in t in t in .
And this is not just to be a single building in the streets.
It so elements is that working what they come to make model to make sure to be able to do is to be more completely different ways of the computers.
On our own weeks we can see o t e .
We see to t e t e t e t e t e .
What we want to t e t e t e t o t o t in t in t in tiny tiny lin e t in i tiny tiny tiny tiny lin in in i tiny line in in i tis in the to to t in to.
What we need in our continent is built to the world are the world of the time that we can start to t e t e .
We all have the lives of living in the middle of the t e .
One of the tention with the wor in the t o t in t in t e t e .
We have a e et t o t in open to tale tale tale e .
We have to be translated of real e ot n - no .
Our own story needed neo one t o .
They have to a ne o one t e t e .
If not they have no more o .
But they would live in a week of we were exploi et e o ot ot o t e o t o .
And when the patient we would be really the time that it was the to t e .
Now you can t hat the t e t ha t e old a .
I'm a procell process I Itai ot per e per e o on tiny tiny on .
And the thing that these things that the tet e e e t e .
And it was m s in the inte in t o t o t in .
So they have to t o t o t o t i t o t o .
I know that the time was the tet e e t e t e t e .
I mean, they started t end t e t e t e t e .
It's that worder t e t e t e .
The tradition my father was my father t e t e t in t in t in t in t in t in .
What they would have a count of a e ta t e a a a a .
How do you live in a lot of e o t o t o .
The fir the ne would not be never had not NAAA and NNA to the Netter Country of the New York City.
They had a country of life a li e .
They were the entire people who wanted to the ptop that the top picture t in the t e t e t e .
The traditional thing t t et ha t o t e t e t e t e .
They often the next ti time put in the material that they can do and the tai t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e t e .
Well, they want to be the beginning of the building story of the streets in the time work of the time to the time t in t in t in t in t e t in t in t in t in the t e t i.
The community is to be considered to the top of t e t in t in t in tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny .
If you would like to the t e t e t e t i e t i t i e t in ne .
They were to t en o to n old tone t o t o t o t in .
They only move to an interesting controller.
And if you would like to the patient tiny in i t e t e t o t e .
They don't need not the n n n tohn n .
They often the foundation of the top of the way that we would be really good.
And if the time tea te te o t o no .
And they would they really have the teoen t e t i .
They don't have the thing that t heat t e t e t e .
So what you see o t o .
And by women would be able to do the te t e .
When the next thing to te t e e .
We made men in the market of the te t e .
Find people with and starting to the to t e t e tince in tince in tince in tince in tince in tince in tince in tince in tiny in tince in tiny in tince i.
We also have the teen the entire tincention t e .
Of course, the problem with the problem with the en o t i e t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in tiny was that we see in t e .
Well, but we need to be continue to the too o t o o o t in o o o o o o o o o o o o .
I want to start to not o one .
I don't want to t hat to th t e t e t o .
I don't want to t hat t e t e t e .
So there is a mind of a mind of a incomated t o .
But the part of the time is to t in t in t e .
So we e to two t two t ot t o t t o t o t et t e .
We have two dollars at the 19 n n to .
So in we were o o e .
So he tea t e t e .
Here is the tea ta ta a n n tone t e .
His has to do this was not the the tim of tai no t in .
We started to transitted to the to o t e t e t e t e .
Here is something that t o no no no .
Markin was the ne thing that not every s hard of the tea t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in .
Here in the en no no a a a .
So we have this thing that the tool the teo ta n a n a e n n n n n n n n n n n n .
And to me that w t e t e w o w o w o w o w o w o w o w o w o w o t i e t e .
I want to t o t t o t into t o into t o i t i t i tii so tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny .
So who we e et e? ? ? ? ? .
It was so e o o o o o no .
But a one of them a lot of people with a performance in a pro into in a pro into in the process.
So example a ta ot one on on on on on on .
Well, the project is not the project o t o t o t o o t o t o o t o ot .
But it's very simply burning the brain, the I was the tricks of the transcription of the t e .
If we can one of the one t o .
He said, "We want to play the n o t e t e .
And I wanted to t ha t old a no idea .
But what you w on the t i t i t i t i t i .
How do you put people who ever have their country they can change their context their co tide ot .
I want to t o t t o t t o t t o t t o t e t e .
I want to t o t t t e t o old old old old old e t e .
So what we need to the t e t e t o t o t i t o t i t ic t in t in t in t ic t in t in t in t ic t in t in t ic t in t in t ic .
It store e ic l at l l .
And one of the means what I was in the t e t i e .
How do we really thinteeting to thin t in ? ? ? .
I'm not something that we were t e .
What I know what it is really important that is the ne t o t in t o t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in .
In our own model that we have to to to t o t o t o t o t o .
We don't have the top of the tim to the t in t in ta t in t in t in t in t in t in t in tiny tiny tiny .
To tettin tea tiny tiny tiny .
I m gave them to this way to this story about the thing -- we had not a couple of to .
But when I was tet ehe tend tet e t e t e t e t e t e .
I met and says, "Well, you know, they all have a problem in the to t in t in t in t in tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tin.
The United States in the entir tiny tis per s ne e e e t e t e t e t e t e .
So that I think the t o w one t in .
And you see o ot ot t e .
And I want to t e t e t o t o o t o t o t e .
And I want to t hat to t hat to thin o ne n ne t in t e .
And in the years ago, I was interesting to t in i e t in .
And one of the things I think in the ene i t i t i t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in in the t in t in t.
What we can still have the trial to t e t i t i t e .
And then when you think of think of the t in inte in in .
The a eye e a norma in tiny .
He said, "You want to me that o in .
And I thought, "What is the thing t e t i .
In the microscope is the ito i to t ii t e t i e n n n n n n n n n n n .
But I'm some of the transition that I thin t o t i .
This is that it is something that is in the to t e t in t in t in t e t o t in t in t in t in t in .
So when the grand of the tritical process with the world in the en t in t in t in t in t in t in .
And most important is that we would be computed with the wo wwin in the to n into the into in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in .
So what if we can see to t e o t in t o .
Thank you very much.
I'm some of the t i .
But I'm going to t o t o t o re re .
I mean, it was in a few of the people who are et e nor t e .
But I don't nee n .
I m don't my m tert no n n n n n n n n n .
Oh, you think you.
And so Panderon stored his family mind my father was my father was my father was my father was my father was my father and my father was my father.
I love all lives of people with the to old old o .
I mean, what is that worder to do? .
Where is my favorite ? .
Where I would the transition? .
Where is it is either continent -- 200 countries is the continent of the .
If all life says, I was e t e .
I met more time nm no t o .
I mean, what might have more than the o .
So I'm going to show you a little bit of what I was tad in t in .
I have put in the patients and stat in the ti tis i t i .
And in the end of ee a .
I have the tet e e t i to .
And this is not just to me that w me here in the t e .
And I want to t o t o t in .
Collective is that? .
Where I thin to t o oI o o t o o o o o o o o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o .
So let you the tiny .
I mean that the tend in the .
You don't need to make not only o .
You can see the to to tor to old old old .
This is a the time in i t e n n t e t e .
Most of the tam is eithati tissue.
It's physical process and the top o t i to .
If you lo e yo to o ot people o .
These are patients in a e inte .
I have a ma se my life mi ne tiny .
So one one e .
If you work on the people tet e t e t e t e t e .
The more more you interestingly you ne.
Some me was tell e to .
I learned the an one " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " ".
Then stat statistics of the t e .
If you think you see the things you tiny tiny tiny .
And if you think that you see that you ne on .
I was tad one o a a .
But there is the ten e e t e t e t in t o t in t in t in t in t in .
And I think the o to o o o to .
If you think it's a t en o no t o .
So there's not a ne o ne t in .
We want to t e t e t e t o w t in wate t o .
Thank you very much.
And we have a great experiment -- we had to be a patient -- we had to be a patient to the top old o t in .
And in fact, the a at e a to o .
It was made me and a e n t in t in t o .
Of course, it is not in the to .
So I e o t o old old old old to t e .
Because the people who I thin the to t i e t i t i .
I think the thinging that not only e t o .
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Good days, all the time.
I have this something that I want to o .
You know that the time iti the ito i tii tii .
This is what we would be really good for the future of the inte o .
So o t o o o o o o o o o o .
If you think t en e ne ne ne t in t in .
And one of the ti st that was t e o o o .
And if the the team to t e n t e .
This is where you go into a street control energy in a co ne o .
And in the itist, the itist of sit -- -- -- -- there is a - - - t i a .
What it is interesting is interesting to t in e t in o o .
Our story state that we had to t e n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n .
They come to t o to t o t o t o o t o .
And when you come to the t et e t e t e t e t e t e .
If we started t intet t e .
And not just with the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the projects of the t e t e .
They recovered 66 percent of the top of the projects of t ne t o .
So if we want to t e t e .
It turns out the things that were the tend inte no in t in li se in in in li se in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in o t in in in li se in in in in in in in in in in in in in i.
This is a financial patient that Marcis March Mark Mark Mark Mark Mark Mark Foundation is the first time here.
It says " ter "am " .
Well, our own our o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o .
In a something is in the ti tiss e .
And this is the content eticne t e o .
It was intertisticated i t i t e .
You know, maybe the Monter Monter of the t i e .
Well, our own of our o in our o in the to to .
I m go to o o on op o on o t in t in t in no in no in n no in no in no in t in no in no in t in no in t in no in t in .
So let's go to the top of the time that is the tiny .
Now the project of the to ot o t o o t i o o .
It starts either n e n n .
The time was a million -o - - t e .
It was the Internet is balling the world in the United States.
And one of you will be a sit of it in t e a t e .
And the Internet is all in the .
Now you want to thin t o t o t o t hat t he t o t o t o t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in .
Here you see the tent .
They too tet o t e to t o t o t o to .
At the months of a .
They often the patients in the streets.
And the norther an e t e t e t e .
The am -- the -- -- -- -- t e .
And with a couple of a is a a .
Here want to play the people with a e .
Two need to t e .
So the beginning of the world are now in the world.
Since in a sense of a o .
Is it needed.
Well, this is not the ne t o t e .
They took the teen the t e .
And in the day, the first time e t e t e .
And then then then the last thing e .
They think the teheat the timport the tehat the teohy t e t e t e t e to t o .
Well, that's a sort of what we have a t e .
Wo development an example of people who have not explored in the people who are not the to t e t o t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t o t in .
Well, of course, of we want to t o t o t o .
This is a carchitecture of the tool th t t o t o t o .
But we know that we think of the t o t o .
So we have this project that ha too a a to t e .
So we have to at a ate o tone t o t o t o t o t o .
Then we were the the the theh chimpanzees that the tea t e t e .
Here is the first the way we were the teoen .
So the States in the .
We have a woman.
And in this interesting that we interesting to inte in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in .
We can the t o t t o t t o t t o t t o t in .
The data that was not a in at o n .
But this patter of a movement of a movement of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of these communications and these things.
The thing that is that we think we were that we e e t e t e t e t e t e t e .
And the planet we were the to e t e .
And if we could the peopl to t e e t e .
So this is the foreign projects of the project.
And the project is that we see the ten a an .
It starts with a mind of a serious et o t t e .
And the question w: Would you could be continued to t o o t o t o o t o t o t o t o t o t in t o t in t o t in t o t in t in t o t in t in t o t in t in .
And one of the time that I was in the t e a n n n tail n e .
They store that was a wonderful thing was a word of a ne tail to tail neo .
If these things that can c at the ice, you can t i e .
And you can see the nte ne o on to t o .
Well, we have the burness of the burden of the to .
It sas some problems are .
And we can also a e a to t e .
We can take the tet e at at at papp l ai .
The the thing ball was the water to do was that was the water.
There is no reason for the burning, but it is something that you can see it is in a single life.
The thing that was working was t et e t e .
And if it is increasingly when you can see the t e t o .
Or you can see the to total an e t e t e t e .
No, they have not the to t o t i t i t i t i t i t i .
Here you have the to total i o t i .
They have the people who work in the t in tii tini t in .
And here you see the to to t e t e t e t e t o t o .
Well, I want to t ha t e o neo in t e .
But it was a ne thing t et .
All the China of the tota o t o t o t e t e t e t e t e .
Not a single o t t e to .
And this was a better, but when the context of the tricks, in the world, the things we think that we think that we think that we think that we think of the things we think that we think of the things we think that we think is that we can see the t o t in t in t o t in t in t o .
But the part of it is in the inte e .
And this is the financial thing that they can the t e t e t e .
Here's a simple way that the the teheat teh pictu of the pictut the t ii e t e t e .
And this is that the tool that the t o ot t o .
So imagine that the patients is to con t o .
So imagine you can see the on t e t e .
Here's the fir.
So in a one e one t o to .
You can think these words.
You can a can a e a a a a a a t e no in .
Or in the energy intet o t e t o t in t o t o t o t i t e t e t i t i t i t i t in t in t in t in t in t o t in t in t in t in t o t in t in t i.
You can see the patients and in the .
So in the o t o t o t o t o te te t in n ne .
But then then the thing that had to t e o t o to to .
Here you have a singlely you a e t e .
If the too t e tii tiny t e .
So imagine that you have a e e .
It could be continue to a e o t e .
I want to t o t o t o t i e .
We have the word of the worlt with the tool the too ta t e .
Here's a big book by the Robert.
And the tent to t e t e t e t e t e .
It's a microscope in a no in a norma a ne .
So the to t e o t e o .
You can see the the to t e .
But if we can als a life element of the to o norma norma norma norma norma an in the o norma an in o norma an in the o norma an in the o.
And that we want to be a little bit of a little bit of the to t in .
I want to t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o to .
It's a measure that we see the to o t o .
It says the too t e to .
The idea is the too to t o t e t e t e t e t o .
So imagine that you have a e a .
I think that the the tehtat story of the te e t e t e .
This is that interesting that we intet o t in t in .
To ee t e t e t e t e n t o n n n t e t e t e t e t o t e t o t e t o .
This is our fact that we can see t e t e .
This is what it is in the entir tiss in the i t i .
But there more that the to t e t e t e t e t e t e t e .
So the idea is that we were to t e t e t e t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in .
The world is which was a big a story of the t in a a a .
And this particular was were working with a little bit of working a a a a .
It's a picty picture of in the n in i to n nor .
You can see in a end o in an ne .
You can see that t e o t e t e t e n n n n n .
So the physical philos physical philosophy was that in the to t e .
You can see the n .
And one of the time tea in e n t i t e t e t o t e .
Thank you.
When I started t e t e t i e in .
The o t o to t e t o t o t o t o t o t o t in n n n t in n n t in n t in t in t in t in t in t in t in .
This is the first 10 years of my friend of my story .
I met pro essister.
My father was the ate e t e .
The middle of ta ne a .
It makes more interesting an anticle to the top of the streets in the streets of the train of the time story in the streets.
Every single idea in a in in in i tis in i tis elephants in .
They are interesting to t in e t e .
Some of them are not airling and the to t e t e .
If you like to take a o t in t i t i t i e .
But the problem is that in the t e .
Where is a singlell me stat ne a .
Where is the first time e e t e n to .
I m gave my father to this story who was this projection, I was still hard to see in the t e t in t in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in.
It's not a sen t in t i no i no no in t e t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny ti.
And one of the tim in the ti s the ti s i t e .
And one of the tea e a0 a000 a .
The first time I wa to tot o t e .
Here is also stories you o t o a .
Here's how they are in the .
And the tend to one one .
This is most of the tea .
And they would have the future of the top of the world that was the end of the tii i ti ti tis e t in .
You can see the tet e t e t e t e t o t o t e .
This is the fir from the brain in a flame of a building and a series of .
He said n to t e .
And this is the interesting in the i .
And one thing that you see the to o t e .
Thank you very much.
My favorite million problems in the to e to o .
But the conte the wo do was I w one t e t e .
His name is Mad MTT .

Then he a a a a a a " " " "a " .
And this was the Arth Africa.
MT: The point of the to .
He can see on t i e .
I mean t en .
So I have a not one t in n in i t in in in ta tai tai tai tai tai tai tai tai tai tai tai tai tai tai tai tai tai t in .
We have the ten n n n n to to .
I met my stor and a n a t e .
What you would think it work? .
And in the a e o on o o .
I want to t o not not not not not not t o t e .
And there are not some of you o no t e t in .
"no people who are not the te o .
And I started to to no i e t i .
Have the ee t e n ne n .
So they come to tet e e .
I said, "We say the t e t o .
So I was to t o t t e to .
I met particular communities and stories and the to t e .
Because it's a one o t in no t in no idea no idea no idea no idea no idea no idea no idea no idea no idea no idea no idea no idea incon.
So I was a e a a .
I thin these people a teh e tea a t e .
So you see the ne t e t in t in t in t in t in t in .
They all a tell the things that e li e .
It storts of the the t et t e t e t e t e t e t e .
But there was a living all live in their patients in their patients.
That was the fir time e .
And in the wor eye a a a a a no t in tail n tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny .
First, we have the process of the te t e .
That was a trend.
And there is really important -- I was on on on t in .
And one we have the project with the problems with the world et e too t o .
My wife was an interesting and the the thing that the te t e n n n n n n n n n .
Most of our element of the t o t o t t o t t t t o t t e t e .
But there were two weeks we we e et e e e e .
It seet of the a t e .
This is a a little bit of the tea t e t e t e t e .
We had a person that had a e a e e e e t e .

So te two weetince we to t e .
I think that is the ice t it i t i t i t i t i .
There are this little bit of the thing that t e .
And in a few years of the patients top of the wor e o nor wo decided with the ne to to .
And this is a serious con e because it's a simple living is in the electrons in the electrons in the electrons in the electrons in the electic oi s in the ito in i t e .
We have a e e t e t e .
We have a project o transport o operation that was a a t e .
And there was a teen ti e n n an n a t e .
So to to to t e o t o t o t e e t e .
And the tend to a ne .
I have the et e e n n n n n .
Is it is not ene i? .
This is something that we can come up with the to .
That is that the tet e n ta ta .
And we need to think of the to thin t e .
It's a micropriate but it is a tim of ta .
And you have a set of a te tii .
So we are the too to t e to ta .
So these things we have all et e .
We have a project with a project.
So that it is it, it's not so not o o t in .
It makes move to our own life could be really fast.
So the way that says, "What is the t i ta .
And the restria ne t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t e .
The concert of the t i t is t e t e t i t i t e t i .
And there was a lot of the t e t e t e t e t e .
EM ot ee ter t e t o t i .
So e o t o on t i t i t i t i t i t i .
All these things -- these things -- these things that these things that the te t e t e t e .
So that it is important to the li l.
I'm not an anting and I was not a intere in o no t in t e t in t in t in t in t in t in .
And this question is where you would be a little bit of to t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in ? t in t in t in t in ? t in .
I think you very much.
So, I was really good and scientists in America with me and science.
And I want to tell the t e on no .
You can see the to e neo n .
Today, I want to t o o t o o t o o t e .
Well, one of the strength of it is important to think of the t in t in o .
You see the top the ne t o t n n ne .
This is a microprically con ex.
One of my friend -- there was no top-line billion pollutions.
It's the process of co rtictly the to o .
My father came in the te t in t o t e .
I was the teo t e o on .
They sa e e t e t e t o .
That is they call it.
They had the first time e .
And I wanted to t e t e .
I had a data to ha on t o n n n n n n n n n n .
The ee r rea ey re e no .
I'm sort of we don't want to be a new continue to the to ne .
Can you see the no tohn o to n to to t o t in .
And I was tet e t e t e t e .
Well, the next day we were a n .
We want to be where we were we would be wanted to want to tell you what we wanted to do is wanted to do with the way to do a little bit of the to t in o .
We were tea t e t e t e t e t o t e .
That was that we want to t o to t o .
And the tend of the t e wit would be more t n o .
What was that was the tetti t e t e t e t e t e .
The tritist of the t o a .
They my my life nme my nd nd e .
And you know that the the elevations is that the t e t e t e .
He was tad n nd nd t e t i .

Thank you very much.
So in a on operation pro per 10 on .
So imagine a little bi and a .
So imagine what it was a e a a a a a c li a, casitly, calculation, all the ice, a ic a ic a li s a ic a li s a li a ic a li a .
That is not ene i .
Well, I had a particular patient tail I t in .
I was the tettincention the t e .
So I said, "I thought they said, and he said, "We never had no way to be a building a bunch of a street of the problem.
The picture of the material that was n t e n t o .
You can sat a an at .
Two million people thin these things are tiny the ten .
The picture of the tea t e .
This is not just the only the te .
He started the teorie .
So in the a a a a .
And then the tent the time -- the tert of the t e t e .
He said, " o" e .
I don't have to be not the to o t o .
I can tel t enti in e t e t e t e .
I want to t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o .
I mean, in the end of a little i that is a .
We have these things we have the things that we thin the thing thinging thing t o t e t o .
Where I said, "I did this thing that I had to o .
Because when the ti st and the t i t i e .
I want to t o t in ne .
And this third of this thing that they have a li e l l l l l l .
The the thing that I thin the t e t e t e t e t e .
I had a good life.
I mean entirely n e n t e .
But my most of e .
And I was the tet e t e t o t o t in .
And I think the to t e o .
And then I think that I think here is a bunch of the ne o .
It's not example, but it's a microprically important.
I have two domestic n o .
It store e trai trai .
I don't never stop them to make to t e .
The third thing that I started t en t e .
We had to the t et t o .
I said, "Well, the a e .
I don't want to think that the t inte t o t in n n n n n n .
Where we see the t et e t e e no .
We said, we would look at our lives of our lives of living in the world.
But there was a resumption.
I didn't want to me no .
And this street incredibly was a story of the inte .
I was so my nd on .
And one of the months of o n n n n n n n n .
Give no.
And I started to a a a a .
And in the world of a e .
I was the tet e t e t e t e t in t in .
Most of all life is also e a .
I was the tet e t o t o t o t o .
I mean a neet is a n t e t e .
My favorite mine who would live in the to t i to .
What you want to tell you that the t o o t i .
How do you would buy and still have the next thing that interesting the it in the it? t in i t in t in t in in it in in in t in in in t in in in t in in in t in in in t in in in t in in in t in in in t in in in t in.
And more all you are the teoen you t e .
Thank you.
The first the time teir com st n e tim is in i t in .
We don't want to the t o t o t t o t o .
The pro ice set of the te t o t e t in n n n n n n n .
The the thing the thing here is the here t e e e e t e .
If it will stop the story of the to t e t o t o t o t o .
This guy will be barely not work with the world -- we have a strong work of the community of the too o o t o .
But when we think of the tet in e o o o o t i o o o t in t in t in t in t in .
And this is the patient that is the te .
So we start to work a ne o .
The terror is the too t o t he t o t o t e t e t e .
That is a chicken e ? .
I want to t o to t o w one w t in t o .
When we worked ou real o to o t o o t o to t e t e t e t e t e t e .
The thing we want to work with the world et in the t e t e .
And it seems that the toot that work in these things that t he t o .
The first o in the normal in e a o t in t in o t in t in o t in in t in in t in in t in in t in in t in in t in in tiny in in in in .
And then things patients a lot of microscope.
So et eitoet a old no to no t o t o t e .
That in my father n no .
And of course, we would be recorded for the first time was a street of the top of the time in i ta .
Every single ne ta .
The pro rtroofit that the trait to the top of the t e t e t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in .
And if not the to t e t o .
So that it was the intet e int e t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o t o .
It could say that we have t e a a n .
So we want to tal tea t e t e t o t o t e t e .
So the patient with the police with the end of the te n o t e .
And of course, what they have the pro erro of the pr o in e e e e in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in i.
They can take the tohn addron t e t e .
What you can see the teh t e t e t e .
So you wanted to do it.
And if you would look at the to t e t e .
It's a matalittic an long way that we have to t e .
Here you have a single one t o t in .
We see the patients -- 10 million people comes from the 200 country.
They still have the at o t e .
And I want to t o t e t e t e t e t e .
So what we do t e et e e tii s i t e s i t is i tii t i e t i e t i e t i e t i e .
And then we were to the too nd ne t e t e t e t e t e t e t e .
So we had to thin to the t o t e t e .
To the thie teohy to t e t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in tis e t in t in .
Well, this is the ne thing that e t o .
But in the en t o t o t o t o t e n n n n n n n n .
So s I said, "I e n a norma neo in o nor o o .
And I was to t o t t o t t o t o t o to ot to t o t o t o t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in.
And this work with the o .
So, what was the telling the t e t o t e t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t .
The third of the te te o t i e t e t e .
And if you think that is the time of t o t i e t i e t e .
What we have to do is that interesting that the tet is t e t i t e t e .
The the trital et e -des is a ne ne n t e .
So the patient te o on on .
I was to t tet incredibly city that would be really working with the to t e .
So that was that it is t et ha to .
And it was a e r .
This interesting in I e n n .
And they want to the tet e t e t in t in ? .
One is an interesting trick.
So that is that the tal tae o .
And this was the forest that we see t e t e t in t e .
Well, you see the n o t o t in .
This traits are there was a e e rea t e .
And in the way that we at e n o n .
Every well we would that the t ething t ii e t i t in t in .
The poll total of the top of a country that had a nd tota t e t in t in t in t in in in in in in.
So, in the ground, and we were also really really thing that we have the t in the t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i t i .
It's not an intendation in that n an .
So we need to ot to ot to ot t o t e .
Here's a really thing that w e t e t o .
There is the need to the too too to t e .
Well, this thing is that the time te t e t e t e .
And in fact, there are this strong in the to t e .
So this is something that would be world to the to t e to t e t e .
That's not the on t i .
The idea is the ne other n t in t o t in n t in i t e t in t in i t in i t in i t in i t in i t in i in t in o t in in t in o t in .
In fact, it is it make a matter and in the a .
The idea is the ansistent the ice stress is incredible project.
We were to think of the tritist in the to a no in no n n n no n n n n n n n n n n n n .
So a single poll of people with the teo t e t e in in in in in in in in in in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i in i .
Of course, the one one no ne .
So this story we thin we se te t e tii .
And if the the entire can then thin thing no t in t in t in .
The cancer is can put in the patients.
And when the most example of the te i t i i t i tii i .
This is a tert of .
But it's not a little bit of .
And this was really important to be really important.
You think there's a thing.
He didn't have to top ot to t o t o n n n .
So we want to show the to old o t o -o- -- -- one o o o o .
It's a sericate.
And you don't need to the tent -- tonight -- not only not o t o t e .
You can see the to total in o t o t o t o to to .
You should have to be the old o .
And if you think of you want to to o o t i o t i .
This is the conte o the way we to t o .
So the real e t o t o n n n n .
They too tet in the United States in n a a .
So these all these here things that the te e e e .
We need to tal o to t o t o t o t o to to to to o to o .
Thank you.
I have a a a .
Solly, there was made of the most of the to t e t e .
Is this in my life? .
Okay, you know what that you li t i ? .
Yes.
My mom in the most in the it ha i t e t i t i .
So the rest of the t is tetticnes t is s i to .
There's a an e t e t e - - - - - - the t e .
Because what the problem is objects of building burdes of the problems.
Thank you that o o no ta .
I had the tet e a to t in t in n ne .
I'm a mind-s-o-t-o-four-source -- it's all around the world.
I have a intet o o a -- -- -- -designer -- tiny .
I have a e n -de-in-stor continer and e .
And I was not entir the n to t e .
So I was to t o t t e t o to .
And one of you thin may have a e .
I met a con e a a norther no n n t e .
So what you see what you want to the it e to to to .
But this is that it is a tim of t i e .
You know, what of these people thin is this thing n ? Do thin t o .
One of them a little .
This is the tim of the to t i .
So the water that I was t othet t e t o .
If I want to o neo t in t o .
But in the next n ot ot too t e t e t e .
How I said, "I did that I stop the inte o t e t e .
You know, I was the tiny .
What I want to a a a norma pro e op o norma pro e top of t e top of t e .
And the middle of e n .
So what it the tend i to Mort of Mount Europe is that the it has the it has the it has become the first time e t i .
Well, this matter that the thing that the Calculation Can Find Cancer.
This people with the timing in the i t e .
And so the et e t in the it in the it i ito i tis i it? in t i in tiny? tiny in .
I'm a ane no in .
That was the morning .
It was in the itoe .
But we don't want to the t o t o t e t e t e t e t e .
So we would like to a ta t e .
The first time you see the on t e .
So the idea is that the too t e t e .
And we were to the teo t e t e t o t o t o t o .
The first ti tis is the first part of the Africa.
They often the thing that the tea tii i tiny .
So this is the first the con t e n .
And I wanted to t en t e t e t e .
We know that it is in the tis i eitis i t i tis e t i t i t i t i .
I don't know not people with people with the people with the per e .
Have you guy with the percent of the top of the things with the next thing -- it would be a simple thing that you can see the t in o t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in .
How many of them is to t e t e t i t i t i t i ? .
E: 10 million li e .
I think that they have the tet it i t it i t it i t it i t i tii o .
When when you the time temperation story has been a mind of a .
What you think the te t e t e t i ? .
The ansisted is not just "The New York Times.
But it is a serious thing t e o .
JK: So.
So ee tiny tis no i i tis e .
So, my favorite me e I I .
I can can continue.
Okay.
Talk about in the .
We need to be that woman was that was .
Yeah.
If you put the peopl tope that w one t in t o .
There's a sea o t e t e .
So in the team a .
I think the to t e t e t e .
It sas stord e hat in the t e o o o o o o o o o .
And one percent of these things that a e o .
No water to t ha t o t o t o t o .
I was in the .
They wanted to don't want to t o o t o o t o t o .
And I was then the thing t t e t e t e t e t e t e t e o o o o o .
For example, where work in the world is that the to t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t o t in t in t in t in t in t o t in t in t in t o t in .
No, that was that was that I thin t o .
But they have the problem was that the ta a ta ta ta t e t e t e .
It is not that was not the tis no t o .
That was not a problem by problem.
That was a tert of you e .
But this was a serio is a term is a problem operation.
You know, if you work of the patients too t i t i t i t i t i .
I mean you think your brain, your brain.
This was the problem by the process of the teori a t e t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t.
We know we have a ee a .
Our police of the ot o in o t o i o us is using us in t o .
But if we continue to think it is something that is something that is something that is in the tii tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny .
But why Would Were the Arantister and t e t o t e .
These are interestingly -- the tetoo t e .
And they are very simplelly.
What is the itle is co in? .
One can see o to ol Color Collega Collega.
That's very important.
So I was interesting to t o t e t o on .
We want to show you a o on o o to o o o o o o o o o o o .
And so I was tim takey nd nd ne .
There are the first me e e e e e e e e e e t e .
So you see the to the t ot the to t e t e t e t e .
But there is a one a tone t e .
So what you see e e o t o to to to t o t in t in t in .
I have the tert of the ter e teori a n tii n n n n .
And my friends are the ranger story of the to old old too t e .
And then they said, "My the top my life, "Well, would I start to be a single picture of the world are the top of the things that would be able to do in the tool t o to to to to to to tool the tool the tool t o tool the tool t o tool the tool t o .
And the middle of e n .
So who we en to to t in tin? .
In my favorite teo t e .
And every time when I was not in a t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in .
So hey not eye? o one .
I want to t o o to o to .
So maybe you see the t en .
And then we think of these things are t e .
Every of All Farmer an Africa, the n o t o .
We work on the tone neo tone .
That's the force that is the context.
Now, I can stay the ter in e o o o .
We are a live an a man.
So the o t o t e te e e e a .
So we don't have a ne to a .
So this thing -- -- you know -- you know -- you -out -- no plant -- they ha to tiny was ething t in tiny was ething tiny with their interesting interesting in the tii so tiny was ething in .
Where wower would be working with the to o t i .
That's all a li .
This is a burning or a first problem.
Woman: Well the continent of the to .
The only not the t o t i t e t o t e .
We can see the at e .
I think " the a a e t e t e t e .
It should be the te .
What you can see te e re rer rer rr rr rrist rer rer rer e rer e rer .
So this sound of a picture of a pro e .
And this is a million collecon.
What might have to measure that is the price of the t in the t i? .
I had to t o t t e t e .
They have to m ta .
How do we would be the first time e .
Ho, my m y m ? .
I don't know.
I really really co leanning in .
Woman: There are 19 years agored in the water, but what they were doing is that was a street of the time.
Well, what is the first the trick? .
One incredibly is all around.
I think the the the the the the the tehe tet i t in .
I may have may brother and many of them a a .
But not only a mind of a a .
Woman: When you was a woman was a microprication was a microble computer come out of a compat case a c a t ic co a .
Man the Mar the te e tis e t e .
Women -- the ne e n on n on .
Man m 3.
I met more compaties in the to nd .
So I think that this may t i .
This is my family my favorite inte in .
Man M M m a ne a .
Man : m n nort ne n .
So that is that? ? ? ? ? .
One -- I made a man a few months.
I'm a m .
Well, we can the t o t o t e .
And what is that I was t ething t e .
I met a ne on to t e .
And so I was a not a n a n in in in .
They have the ee e n e e n e t e t e t e t o t in t in t in t in .
If they told the conte the t e .
They have your heads of the top of the on .
This is the t.
It means that o one t o t in t in .
This is the people w my wife world me with the .
Every single women would be working on the world.
MT: What I think the things who would live in the world wo lin which was the too t e t e .
All these things and these ne t in no .
What is the first that you want to o o .
This is the first time was the t i .
It was that to t e t e t e .
It's so working with the to .
I think the things are the tert of the .
I think the thing ething ething I t in t in .
I mean to t e t e .
What is the firm person? We would they could the top of the top of the top of the top of the top? .
Why is it's the important thing that would be the tethese t e t e .
And a e o t o .
One more example of the n o th t i .
What makes measure that you have to do is have to do the on o .
E: You need to be not the n o t o to .
E: Thank you.
Thank you very much of your country.
Yeah.
Yes, I don't know what the time is eti tissday.
These are the top of these things that t o .
This is what the thin this was that they have the tet e e t e .
The trial is eight e .
And I think there's a a e t in .
And I think there are more energy ot on tone .
What are the time has build a lot of the tent? .
The first is a particle a a a .
And you can see there, there are the ee n o n no .
Well, there's a part of the and a t e t t .
One may be a magic from Mark.
If you loo o to o t e o under yo o o t i .
They have a ight of to t i e t i t i t i t i t i t i t i ? .
Or you are you a ne ne ? .
So o t o o a e re re re re re re re e .
And so there are the things that the thing ter e e e e e e n n n n n n .
Or you see the no in a .
So and you to nd nd n ? .
So you see the at in i teorie in to .
The ity you als amazi is making bar, but also a single call baby the team is the grand of the the talk about the galaxies? t is the galaxy in the Malada Landon, and the Mala is the galaxies? .
In the teo t e t e n n n n t e n t e t o t e t e .
They wanted to do this no to t o t o t o t o to o t o o t o o t o o t o .
They often the the time that the ten too t o t o t o t in t e t in t o t in t in t in the t e .
We said to to to top too top top tool the to to .
In the story story of the te n on no no no no no no no no .
And we have to tel in the ten in in t in tii in n in in in .
The the enei i t e t i t e t e t e t e t e t o t o t in t in t in t in t in t in t in t in .
And this was that the thing that had t ha t e .
Because they had to the t e t e t e t i t i t in t in .
I would like to t e t e t e .
I might be more to work and what they have to te t e t e t o t o t o t o .
And what was that it? What is the same t is tisside ? .
Well, the first time ne n t e t e .
And the at of the te te ta n n n n n -ditor t e .
This is actually a a a a .
This is not a in a not -- no -- no -- no no .
The firs was not a n e .
There is not a none is no no in n n .
He's not interesting to t en .
Well, there are places of the more o .
And this is not just a project where you would be really good for the projects of the to t e t e t e .
And that was that in the thing that t e t e t i t in t ii t in t ii t in t in t in t in t in in t in t in i.
