# NLP_Char_Translation

Implementations of two Neural Machine Translation Models:   

**1. CNN-ResNet-BiGRU**    

Paper: ["Fully Character-Level Neural Machine Translation without Explicit Segmentation", 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03017)   
Implementation: [https://github.com/violaciao/Char-NMT](https://github.com/violaciao/Char-NMT)


**2. Quasi-RNN**  
Paper: ["Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks", ICLR 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01576)   
Many thanks to Jay Parks for the public implementation of QRNN, which served as a starting point for our implementation: https://github.com/JayParks/quasi-rnn
